      "Burro Wash - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 1 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Burro Wash Capitol Reef National Park Technical Canyoneering Burro Wash is a clandestine treasure tucked into the Waterpocket Fold of Capitol Reef National Park. The bottom section of the canyon is often enjoyed by hikers seeking a glimpse of a classic sandstone slot canyon. Enjoying the complete adventure offered by this wild canyon requires technical canyoneering skills combined with a vehicle shuttle. The Waterpocket Fold is an immense bulge in the earth's crust known as a monocline in which 14 layers of sedimentary strata were tilted upward. A trip through Burro Wash as it slices through the Waterpocket Fold is a geologic amusement ride. General Information: Burro Wash is a technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon consists of several short swims, wading, downclimbing, rappels and a bunch of fun. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hours. The canyon is unique in the fact that it contains four sections of narrows separated by open canyon. Each section of narrows has it's own personality as it cuts through a different type of sandstone. A vehicle shuttle is required to complete this route. Assuming that both shuttle vehicles are Four wheel drive it takes approximately one hour and 15 minutes to drive the 30 miles between the Lower and Upper Trailheads. The shuttle can be accomplished with passenger cars or high clearance vehicles with differing amounts of success. The lack of four wheel drive could add approximately 2 miles of hiking and 45 minutes of time to the route depending on road conditions. I have completed this route using only passenger vehicles and the extra walking is flat and easy. Burro Wash requires complete technical gear. the longest rappel is 97-feet and requires a 60-meter rope. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system. Wetsuits are required in cold conditions but can usually be skipped during hot or dry weather. There are few bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing additional bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which is moderately difficult in this canyon. Navigation for this route is difficult. A GPS is extremely useful in identifying waypoints on the cross country trek to reach the head of Burro Wash. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Notom\" and \"Golden Throne\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Burro Wash is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to this canyon. Lower Trailhead Information: From the Capitol Reef Visitor Center take Highway 24 east for 9.1 miles to mile marker 88.9 and the signed Notom-Bullfrog turn-off. Turn south at the intersection and follow the paved http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/burro.htm 1/25/2018 Burro Wash - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Notom-Bullfrog Road south for 7.8 miles to the point where Burro Wash crosses under the road. The wash is signed and has a large paved pull-out on the west side of the road. Any vehicle can access this point and all roads are paved, this is where passenger vehicles will need to park. Four wheel drive and high clearance vehicles can enter the wash and drive west for 1.5 miles to a nice camp spot where you can park out of flashflood danger near an old Cottonwood tree. This is the Lower Trailhead and where you will need to leave a shuttle vehicle. Note: It has been recently reported (unconfirmed) that four wheel drive and high clearance vehicles can no longer drive up the bottom of Burro Wash. All vehicles must now park at the passenger vehicle pull-out on the Notom-Bullfrog Road. Upper Trailhead Information: From the Capitol Reef Visitor Center follow the paved Scenic Drive south into the park for 7.9 miles to the end of the pavement. When the pavement ends the road splits with the Left (east) Fork heading into Capitol Gorge and the Right (south) Fork heading toward Pleasant Creek. Take the Right (south) Fork signed Pleasant Creek and follow the main dirt road south for an additional 2.8 miles to Pleasant Creek. Passenger cars can be driven down the maintained dirt road to the parking area and vault toilet located at Pleasant Creek. Four wheel drive and high clearance vehicles drive across Pleasant Creek and continue south on the unmaintained South Draw Road for 1.1 miles, at this point the road enters a wash. This is the Upper Trailhead. A signpost identifies it with an arrow marking the direction of the South Draw road and a very faint mining track leading southeast from the wash. Four wheel drive vehicles will have no problem accessing this trailhead. High clearance vehicles should be able to reach this trailhead in normal conditions. Passenger cars can normally be driven to the parking area and vault toilet at Pleasant Creek, which is 1.1 miles short of the actual trailhead. The actual trailhead is not accessible to passenger cars. Park out of the wash in an area safe from flash flood. Route Information: From the Upper Burro Wash Trailhead (N38° 10' 02\", W111° 10' 38\"), locate a faint mining track that slowly climbs through the brush and pinion trees in a southeast direction up the reef. The track will cross through two minor drainage's. The second drainage is reached after approximately 12 minutes and 1/2 mile of hiking. 100 yards after crossing the second minor drainage leave the mining track (N38° 09' 47\", W111° 10' 27\") and scramble straight up the steep hill to a minor saddle (N38° 09' 38\", W111° 10' 22\") 1/4 mile distant. From the top of the minor saddle the route loops southward around the face of the escarpment until two large, easily identified, notches are located at the top of the reef. The two notches are separated by a huge balanced boulder on the ridge between them. Scramble up and through the northern notch. When you reach the top of the northern notch (N38° 09' 30\", W111° 10' 04\") you are at the head of Burro Wash. It will take you approximately 1 hour to reach the head of Burro Wash. Start heading down canyon and enjoy the ride. You will be forced to do some minor bushwhacking for the first 1/4 mile but as small drainage's begin to funnel into the main canyon the brush disappears. The first section of good narrows you reach are in the Wingate Sandstone, in this section you will encounter a fun downclimb. Its pretty simple to accomplish this downclimb but beginners might want a belay. Next you will encounter a 35-foot dryfall, you can rappel this dryfall using a sling around the large boulder or you can climb out of the slot on the south (right) side and simply walk around the small obstacle. Keep heading down canyon and enjoy the scenery. In the next section of narrows you will likely encounter some some deep wading or possible short swimming. None of the swimming involve in the canyon is more then a couple of yards. Soon you will arrive at the first required rappel. This rappel is 25-feet into a possible knee deep pool of water. The rappel is anchored by a http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/burro.htm 1/25/2018 Burro Wash - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 bolt on the south (right) canyon wall. Just below the rappel is a really nice section of slot with a short slide. The slide usually yields some nice pictures so get the camera ready. After the slide is a long section of mostly open canyon and then the final section of narrows presents itself. You will be stopped by a dryfall with no visible anchor to rappel. The secret to defeating this obstacle is that the tree 30-feet down canyon on the south (right) side is the rappel anchor. The rappel is from slings around the tree and is 40-feet to the canyon bottom. Keep your rope out at the bottom of this rappel because you are about to finish up with the final rappel. The final rappel is 97-feet and is anchored by two bolts in the north (left) wall. You will rappel 30-feet into a small pothole and then continue over the next edge to complete the total 97- foot rappel. The bottom of the rappel is the usual high point reached by ambitious hikers coming from the bottom and hiking up the canyon. You still have a lot of scrambling, wading and possible swimming as you continue hiking and exploring down canyon. Just keep hiking down canyon and you will eventually reach a sign marking the National Park Boundary. The Lower Trailhead (N38° 11' 15\", W111° 06' 43\"), is approximately 1/2 mile past the boundary sign. Optional Route Information: Burro Wash can be visited and enjoyed by hikers. Drive to the Lower Trailhead and hike up the wash as far as your skill and time allows. Burro Wash from the bottom is rated 2B II using the Canyon Rating System. Hikers will likely encounter knee to waist deep wading in the first section of slot canyon. Determined hikers attempting to reach the bottom of the final rappel might encounter some short swimming. Attempting this canyon from the bottom up is a great adventure for hikers wishing to experience a nice slot canyon.

This slot canyon packs a big bang into a small package with great views, three natural bridges, seven rappels and an all-around good time. General Information: Cassidy Slot is a technical canyoneering route that requires complete technical gear and the experience to use it. Cassidy Slot is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. This route is suitable for novice canyoneers with advanced leadership. The route will require 3 to 4 hours from trailhead to trailhead. This route is accessible year round provided there is no snow on the ground. The route requires two 140-foot ropes. The longest rappel in the canyon is 135-feet. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. This canyon contains no water and wetsuits are not required. Navigation for this route is easy. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Fruita\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a mild flash flood danger. The drainage is small and a clear view of the western sky is available on the approach. Check the local weather report before committing. Trailhead Information: From the Capitol Reef Visitor Center (N38° 17' 28\", W111° 15' 41\") follow the paved Scenic Drive south into the National Park for 3.4 miles to the signed Grand Wash Road (N38° 15' 22\", W111° 13' 58\"). Turn east (left) and follow the well maintained gravel road for 1.3 miles to the Grand Wash Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to locate as the road ends in a large parking area with a vault toilet and information kiosk. All vehicles should be able to access this trailhead in dry weather conditions. Route Information: From the Grand Wash Trailhead (N38° 15' 49\", W111° 13' 57\") hike east down Grand Wash for 1/4 mile to the signed Cassidy Arch Trail Junction (N38° 15' 57\", W111° 12' 48\"). Take the Cassidy Arch Trail and follow it as it climbs the north canyon wall for 1 mile to a second junction (N38° 15' 52\", W111° 13' 29\") signed Cassidy Arch. Continue following the Cassidy Arch Trail west for an additional 1/4 mile to Cassidy Arch (N38° 15' 40\", W111° 13' 33\"). The first rappel is located on the north (left) side of Cassidy Arch near a tree. The rappel is 135-feet high and was historically anchored from a sling around a tree. In July 2016 a bolt station was established 25-feet east of the tree on a ledge. The bolt station created a better start to the rappel and makes pulling your ropes much easier than using the historical anchor. The first rappel deposits you in the canyon bottom below the arch. The best view of Cassidy Arch is from between the first and second rappel, so take a minute and look around. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/cassidyslot.htm 1/25/2018 Cassidy Slot Canyon - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 The second rappel immediately follows the first and is anchored from two bolts on the south (right) canyon wall. The second rappel is 120-feet and deposits you in a fascinating cavern. The third rappel quickly follows and is anchored from two bolts on the south (right) wall. The rappel is 25-feet and deposits you above a nice natural bridge and the top of the fourth rappel. The fourth rappel is anchored from two bolts on the north (left) wall. The rappel is 25-feet through the center of the natural bridge. This is one of the more photogenic rappels on the route. The fifth rappel follows immediately after and is 40-feet. The rappel is anchor by two bolts in the north (left) canyon wall. A short 10-foot downclimb follows and the canyon makes a sharp right turn to the south and begins to open up. Next up is the sixth rappel through the third natural bridge. This rappel is 50-feet and is anchored from two bolts in the east (left) canyon wall. The seventh rappel at first appears a little tricky but if you look you will find old steps carved into the east (left) wall of the canyon. Follow the steps up to an old cable walkway that leads out to two bolts in the canyon wall. You could chance the old walkway, rickety bridge and downclimb, but it's safer to just rappel 50-feet to the canyon floor. Continue downcanyon to the eighth and final rappel, which is 40-feet and anchored by a slung tree. At the base of the final rappel look for the undercut on the west (right) wall and crawl through the interesting cavern. Follow the social trail back to the Grand Wash Road (N38° 15' 42\", W111° 13' 13\") and hike the short distance back to the trailhead. History: I have been told the old wooden bridge, carved steps and cable walkway found in Cassidy Slot are the remnants of a polygamist hideaway developed for when the Federal marshals came to Fruita looking to make trouble for the polygamist families living in the area.

The route description below offers two options, the first is a nice technical canyoneering route and the second is an awesome hiking route. This canyon offers up a fantastic selection of slots and narrows for those willing to explore. Interested in viewing a short video clip of the Cottonwood Wash? This video was taken over Memorial Day Weekend. *Cottonwood Wash Video* General Information: Cottonwood Wash is a technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon consists of short swims, wading, downclimbing, rappels and a bunch of fun. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 6 to 7 hours. A vehicle shuttle is required to complete this route. Assuming that both shuttle vehicles are four wheel drive it takes approximately one hour and 30 minutes to drive the 33 1/2 miles between the Lower and Upper Trailheads. The shuttle can be accomplished with passenger cars or high clearance vehicles with differing amounts of success. The lack of four wheel drive could add approximately 4 1/2 miles of hiking and 1 1/2 hours of time to the route depending on road conditions. Cottonwood Wash requires complete technical gear. A 100-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 75 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. I suggest a maximum group size of six because of the slow going and environmental impact involved with larger groups. Cottonwood Wash contains approximately 3 rappels depending on your downclimbing abilities. The longest rappel you will encounter is 45-feet, but the anchor is located 40 feet back from the edge so bring plenty of webbing. Full wetsuits or drysuits are required during cool or cold weather. During hot weather (90 degrees plus) Shorty wetsuits might be required for those who get cold easily, those traveling in larger groups or if the canyon has experienced recent rain. This canyon has the potential to hold a large amount of water depending on recent weather conditions. Navigation for this route is moderate. A GPS is useful in identifying the correct entrance to the head of Cottonwood Wash. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Notom\" and \"Golden Throne\" are essential. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing additional bolts, so please play fair. The natural anchors are easy to locate in this canyon if you know what a big tree looks like. Cottonwood Wash is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/cottonwood.htm 1/25/2018 Cottonwood Wash - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to this canyon. Lower Trailhead Information: From the Capitol Reef Visitor Center take Highway 24 east for 9.1 miles to mile marker 88.9 and the signed Notom-Bullfrog turn-off. Turn south at the intersection and follow the paved Notom-Bullfrog Road south for 9.0 miles to the point where Cottonwood Wash crosses under the road. The wash is signed and there are several primitive campsites next to the road. Any vehicle can access this point and all roads are paved, this is where passenger vehicles will need to park. Four wheel drive and high clearance vehicles can enter the wash and drive west, up the bottom of the wash, for 1.1 miles to where the road ends, park out of flashflood danger. This is the Lower Trailhead and where you will need to leave a shuttle vehicle. Upper Trailhead Information: From the Capitol Reef Visitor Center follow the paved Scenic Drive south into the park for 7.9 miles to the end of the pavement. When the pavement ends the road splits with the Left Fork heading into Capitol Gorge and the Right Fork heading toward Pleasant Creek. Take the Right Fork signed Pleasant Creek and follow the main dirt road south for an additional 2.8 miles to Pleasant Creek. Passenger cars can be driven down the maintained dirt road to the parking area and vault toilet located at Pleasant Creek. Four wheel drive and high clearance vehicles drive across Pleasant Creek and continue south on the unmaintained South Draw Road for 3.3 miles. This is the Upper Trailhead. There is nothing around to identify the Upper Trailhead; it is just an accommodating location to pull off the road. Conditions of this road vary over the last 6 miles. Four wheel drive vehicles will have no problem accessing this trailhead. Skillfully driven high clearance vehicles should be able to reach this trailhead in normal conditions. Passenger cars can be driven to the parking area and vault toilet at Pleasant Creek, which is 3.3 miles short of the actual trailhead. The actual trailhead is not accessible to passenger cars. Park in an area safe from flash flood. Route Information: From the Upper Cottonwood Wash Trailhead (N38° 8' 22\", W111° 10' 14\"), begin hiking southeast and let the terrain funnel you through a saddle into the upper canyon entrance (N38° 08' 15\", W111° 09' 45\"). This approach will be easier if you locate an old miners track and can follow it to the top of the Shinarump bench. From the canyon entrance begin hiking down canyon and let the fun begin. You will pass through several different sandstone formations beginning with Wingate, followed by Kayenta, which leads to Navajo. Any slot rat can tell you that Navajo Sandstone is where you usually find the good stuff. Just after entering the Navajo sandstone you will encounter the first rappel. It is 40-feet and anchored from a tree. Shortly after the first rappel you will encounter a second rappel of 40-feet anchored from a rock outcropping. In normal conditions you will encounter several sections of wading and some downclimbing through this nice section of slot. After enjoying the first section of narrows the canyon opens up some and you will encounter two large dryfalls one immediately after the other. Both dryfalls can be easily bypassed on the south (right) side. At the bottom of the second dryfall the canyon immediately slots up really nice. Scramble down the slot and shortly you will encounter the third rappel. This rappel is 45-feet and anchored from a tree. The tree is in the center of the canyon and located 40- feet back from the lip of the dryfall. If no safe anchor currently exists when you arrive you will need the appropriate length of webbing to properly rig this rappel anchor. This dryfall usually stops most resourceful hikers coming up from the bottom. After the third rappel you will immediately encounter a 15-foot dryfall, this can be rappelled using a tree as the anchor or downclimbed by the ambitious. A deep pool or swim often exists at the bottom of this dryfall. Below the final rappel, In normal conditions, you will encounter several sections of wading, at least one short swim and some downclimbing as you continue down canyon. As http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/cottonwood.htm 1/25/2018 Cottonwood Wash - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 technical canyons go this one is on the easier side of things. After a long an enjoyable experience in the Cottonwood fun center the reef will begin to open up. Just keep hiking down canyon and you will eventually reach the face of the reef, the Lower Cottonwood Wash Trailhead (N38° 09' 55\", W111° 06' 16\") is approximately 1/2 mile past the face of the reef. For those without a high clearance vehicle you must keep hiking an additional mile to reach the Bullfrog/Notom road (N38° 09' 57\", W111° 05' 22\"). Optional Route Information: Cottonwood Wash can be visited and enjoyed by hikers. Drive to the Lower Trailhead and hike up the wash as far as your skill and time allows. Cottonwood Wash from the bottom is rated 2B III using the Canyon Rating System. From the Lower Trailhead begin hiking up the wash. Soon you will come to a small dryfall that can be passed on the south (left) side. At this point a use trail traverses the south side of the canyon and eliminates a bunch of boulder hopping in the canyon bottom. If you miss the use trail it's no big deal, just enjoy the boulders. Just as the canyon begins to slot up you will encounter a junction. If you continue straight (left) the canyon boxes out in a short distance, take the north (right) fork and continue up canyon. There are a couple moderate climbs as you pass through more boulders. Next you'll hit a huge chockstone that appears to block your path. There is a short tunnel route beneath the chokestone that allows you to continue on. Just past the huge chokestone the canyon really slots up nice. It is also at this point that you will probably encounter water that requires deep wading or swimming. This obstacle turns most novice back, but it is worth the effort to get wet and continue on because the best part of the canyon is just beginning. For the next mile, the canyon alternates between tight narrows and open stretches. You will encounter a number of obstacles that can be defeated with teamwork and ingenuity. Eventually a 45-foot dryfall blocks your path from continuing up canyon and marks the end of the route for most canyoneers. The really hardcore can backtrack 1/4 mile and exit out of the slot on the south side and climb up and around the 45-foot dryfall. Bypassing the dryfall is for experienced hikers with good route finding skills only.

The canyon contains what some consider to be the best narrows to be found in the Waterpocket Fold, but to visit these narrows you must be willing to pay the piper. The approach to the head of the canyon requires an ugly four wheel drive shuttle or a long hike. Enjoying the treasures offered by this wild canyon requires navigational and technical canyoneering skills. The Waterpocket Fold is an immense bulge in the earth's crust known as a monocline in which 14 layers of sedimentary strata were tilted upward. A trip through Fivemile Wash as it slices through the Waterpocket Fold is a geological trip through time. General Information: Fivemile Wash is a technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon consists of several short swims, wading, downclimbing, rappels up to 30 feet and a bunch of fun. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 7 to 8 hours. A vehicle shuttle is required to complete this route. Assuming that both shuttle vehicles are four wheel drive it takes approximately one hour and 30 minutes to drive the 32 1/2 miles between the Lower and Upper Trailheads. The shuttle can be accomplished with passenger cars or high clearance vehicles with differing amounts of success. The lack of four wheel drive could add approximately 3 1/2 miles of hiking and 1 1/2 hours of time to the route depending on road conditions. Fivemile Wash requires complete technical gear. A 60-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. I suggest a maximum group size of six because of the slow going and environmental impact involved with larger groups. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which is not difficult in this canyon. In place of bolts, teamwork and partner assisted techniques are used extensively in this canyon so go prepared. Fivemile Wash contains 2 or 3 rappels if you possess some downclimbing abilities; the number of rappels increases if your skills need work. The longest rappel you will encounter is 30-feet. You will be wet for several hours and encounter several sections of swimming and wading. Full wetsuits or drysuits are required on cooler days. During hot weather (90 degrees plus) Shorty wetsuits might be required for those who get cold easily or those traveling in larger groups. This canyon has the potential to hold large amounts of water depending on recent weather conditions. Navigation for this route is difficult. A GPS is extremely useful in identifying the correct entrance to the head of Fivemile Wash. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Bear Canyon\", \"Sandy Creek Benches\", \"Notom\" and \"Golden Throne\" are essential. This is http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/fivemile.htm 1/25/2018 Fivemile Wash - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 one of the rare canyons which crosses four different USGS 7.5' Maps. Fivemile Wash is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to this canyon. Lower Trailhead Information: From the Capitol Reef Visitor Center take Highway 24 east for 9.1 miles to mile marker 88.9 and the signed Notom-Bullfrog turn-off. Turn south at the intersection and follow the paved Notom-Bullfrog Road south for 10.1 miles to the point where Fivemile Wash crosses under the road. The wash is signed and has a large pull-out on the east side of the road. Any vehicle can access this point and all roads are paved. This is the Lower Trailhead and where you will need to leave a shuttle vehicle. Upper Trailhead Information: From the Capitol Reef Visitor Center follow the paved Scenic Drive south into the park for 7.9 miles to the end of the pavement. When the pavement ends the road splits with the Left Fork heading into Capitol Gorge and the Right Fork heading toward Pleasant Creek. Take the Right Fork signed Pleasant Creek and follow the main dirt road south for an additional 2.8 miles to Pleasant Creek. Passenger cars can be driven down the maintained dirt road to the parking area and vault toilet located at Pleasant Creek. Four wheel drive and high clearance vehicles drive across Pleasant Creek and continue south on the unmaintained South Draw Road for 3.5 miles. This is the Upper Trailhead. There is nothing around to identify the Upper Trailhead; it is just an accommodating location to pull off the road. Conditions of this road vary over the last 7 miles. Four wheel drive vehicles will have no problem accessing this trailhead. Skillfully driven high clearance vehicles should be able to reach this trailhead in normal conditions. Passenger cars can be driven to the parking area and vault toilet at Pleasant Creek, which is 3.5 miles short of the actual trailhead. The actual trailhead is not accessible to passenger cars. Park in an area safe from flash flood. Route Information: From the Upper Fivemile Wash Trailhead (N38° 8' 22\", W111° 10' 14\"), locate an obvious saddle to the south in the reef. The saddle is located northeast from the easy to identify Buck Point. This saddle is your first destination. There is a good chance you will stumble across an old mining track, which appears and disappears, that leads nearly to the saddle. The final climb to the saddle is steep but not difficult. It is important that you have the proper maps and know how to read them because it is easy to get sucked into the south fork of Cottonwood Wash while attempting to reach the correct saddle. From the center of the saddle (N38° 7' 30\", W111° 10' 10\"), start heading down canyon and enjoy the ride. You will be forced to do a long stretch of boulder hopping for the first few miles as you descend into the depths of the canyon. There are several arches and bridges high on the canyon walls in this section so keep your eyes open. Just as you begin to grow weary of the boulder hopping you will encounter the first section of narrows cutting through the Wingate Sandstone. These narrows are often referred to as the \"Box Elder Narrows\" because of the numerous box elder trees growing in and around the narrows. These narrows are not particularly impressive but they sure beat the boulder hopping. It is in the Box Elder Narrows that you will encounter your first major obstacle, which is a 30' rappel. The anchor for this rappel is a large box elder tree at the top of the drop. After exiting the Box Elder Narrows you will be presented with a slog. The slog continues until you begin cursing me for giving you this route information. At the moment you decide there is no worthwhile narrows in this canyon and approximately four hours after you left the trailhead you will encounter the real fun and the beginning of a fantastic slot. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/fivemile.htm 1/25/2018 Fivemile Wash - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 From this point on it is all fun and games. You will find swimming, wading, downclimbing and perhaps two more short rappels depending on your downclimbing skills. After a long an enjoyable experience in the Fivemile waterpark the reef will begin to open up. Just keep hiking down canyon and you will eventually reach the face of the reef, the Lower Fivemile Wash Trailhead (N38° 9' 8\", W111° 5' 0\") is approximately 1/2 mile past the face of the reef. Optional Route Information: Fivemile Wash can be visited and enjoyed by hikers. Drive to the Lower Trailhead and hike up the wash as far as your skill and time allows. Fivemile Wash from the bottom is rated 2B II using the Canyon Rating System. Those with no climbing or route finding skills will be stopped shortly after entering the best section of narrows by a deep pothole with a very difficult climb out on the far side. Those with climbing skills, the correct water level, a short rope and a lot of luck might be able to climb through the pothole. All others will need to backtrack a considerable distance to where a side canyon enters from the north. Where the side canyon enters there is a ledge on the north side that takes you up past the lower potholes. The walk around is easy and once past the lower potholes you should be able to climb up Fivemile Wash a considerable distance, perhaps even to the top.

Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Happy Dog aka: S Canyon Capitol Reef National Park Technical Canyoneering Happy Dog is a remote and challenging canyon located after a long hike down Halls Creek near Lake Powell. The route is often combined with other canyons in the area to create a multi-day backpack trip. This route visits an isolated section of the Waterpocket Fold on the periphery of Capital Reef National Park. General Information: Happy Dog Canyon is a technical canyoneering route that requires complete technical gear and experience. The canyon is rated 3B R V using the canyon rating system. A backcountry permit is not required for this route as you are camping just outside of Capitol Reef National Park. Spring and fall are the preferred times of year to attempt this route. The route is brutally hot in summer. The route is divided into two parts, the approach to camp at Millers Creek, and the actual Happy Dog Canyon itself. The approach to your camp requires an 8 1/2 mile hike down Halls Creek, over Halls Divide, to Millers Creek. There is no water to pump for the first 5 miles. It will take approximately 6 to 8 hours to reach your camp at Millers Creek. The Happy Dog technical canyoneering route will require approximately 6 to 8 hours to complete starting and ending at camp on Millers Creek. The route requires two 50-meter (165-foot) ropes. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 75-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. This canyon contains bolted rappel anchors that are ancient and in poor condition. You might be forced to construct your own anchors or replace existing anchors so go prepared. The canyon contains squeezing, stemming, and silo work. There are at least 5 rappels from a combination of natural and bolted anchors, with the longest rappel being 150-feet. The lower section of the canyon is shady and incised and will contain unavoidable water which will require wading and swimming. Wetsuits are advised on cold days or for people with low cold tolerance. The final rappel is into a very cool alcove with good pumpable water. Keep a careful watch as there are several sections of poison ivy along the route. Navigation for this route is challenging; a GPS is a highly advised. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Deer Point\", \"Stevens Canyon North\", and \"Halls Mesa\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. On the approach to camp at Miller Creek you will follow a combination of game trails, old wagon road and streambed. The technical portion of the route contains no trails and nearly the entire approach is on slickrock. The route finding at the head of the canyon is extremely convoluted with a maze of fins and small buttes, with a steep ramp leading into the canyon proper. Good route finding skills are required. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/happydog.htm 1/25/2018 Happy Dog - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger with good high points out of the water course, with the exception of the lower third which has limited options for escape. The drainage is short with a clear view of the western sky. Check the local weather report before committing. Trailhead Information: Happy Dog does not require a vehicle shuttle. The trailhead is accessible to passenger cars in normal conditions. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Not all roads described are shown on the USGS map. From Ticaboo, Utah drive south on Highway 276 for 7.0 miles to a junction with the paved Burr Trail Road (N37° 34' 32\", W110° 42' 43). Turn west (right) on to the paved Burr Trail Road. Follow the paved Burr Trail Road 18.5 miles to a dirt road and a small wood sign that reads \"Halls Creek Overlook\" (N37° 44' 47\", W110 ° 54' 33\"). Turn west (Left) and follow the dirt road 5.0 miles to a junction (N37° 41' 17\", W110° 54' 43\"). Turn west (right) and follow the dirt road 0.4 to a bend in the road (N37° 40' 59\", W110° 54' 35\"). passenger cars might want to park here. Those with a high clearance vehicle keep following the dirt road to the west 0.6 miles to the Airstrip Trailhead. There is no water at the Trailhead. Some refer to the Airstrip Trailhead as the \"Short Cut\", this is because the Halls Creek Trailhead suggested by the National Park Service begins at the Halls Creek Overlook. The Short Cut trims over 5-miles of slogging off your route in both directions. The penalty for taking the Short Cut is the route from canyon rim to canyon floor requires moderate route finding skills. The first pumpable water is 5.0 miles down Halls Creek, after Halls Divide. Approach Hike Information: From the Airstrip Trailhead (N37° 40' 41\", W110° 54' 53\") hike west and down to the obvious break in the cliff band. Work your way through the cliff band and start descending the steep exposed drainage, trending to your south (left) to avoid the cliffs below you. Do not under estimate this descent. It is steep and loose, finishing 1000-feet below you on a game trail (N37° 40' 27\", W110° 55' 14\"). Turn south (left) on the game trail and follow it for 4 miles to Halls Creek Divide (N37° 37' 43\", W110° 52' 57\"). The trail weaves in and out of the wash several times in this first 4 miles, but mostly follows the benches on the east (left) side of Halls Creek to Halls Creek Divide. After Halls Creek Divide continue hiking south down Halls Creek for 4 miles. The game trail occasionally follows an old wagon road and meanders across Halls Creek several times, but generally stays on the benches to the west (right) of Halls Creek for the last 3 miles to Millers Creek (N37° 34' 37\", W110° 52' 10\"). The game trail is unreliable. It disappears and reappears randomly. It is an unofficial trail and is not marked or maintained. Millers Creek has respectable camping with shade and good pumpable water. It also makes for a good base camp to complete additional routes in the area. Route Information: From Millers Creek hike south 1/4 mile down Halls Creek to a large Cottonwood tree and bench (N37° 34' 27\", W110° 52' 16\"). This is the start of the canyon approach. At this point you will be ascending 1300-feet up the Waterpocket Fold on slickrock to the head of Happy Dog. On your approach you will have great views from the north rim into Happy Dog Canyon. Your approach is the north rim of the canyon. Try not to follow the rim too closely as the canyon meanders quite a bit. Climb to the high point (N37° 34' 40\", W110° 52' 44\") for the best views into the canyon. Continue working your way up the slickrock to a ridgeline (N37° 34' 40\", W110° 53' 21\") that drops into Millers Creek on the north and Happy Dog on the south side. From this ridgeline to the head of Happy Dog Canyon you will work your way through a maze of fins and small buttes to reach a steep ramp that allows access into Happy Dog (N37° 34' 34\", W110° 53' 29\"). Total approach time from Millers Creek to the head of the canyon is 1 to 2 hours. The head of the canyon is recognized by a really cool arch and hanging valley. The canyon http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/happydog.htm 1/25/2018 Happy Dog - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 head falls both into Millers Creek and Happy Dog. Very unique! Work your way down canyon with some moderate downclimbs that might require a partner assist. The first rappel comes quickly and is off a tree in the water course. This rappel is overhung and can be tricky to get over the edge without sticking your device. After this the canyon opens up and narrows down a couple of times with a few pools of water and potholes that can be stemmed over or walked around pretty easily. Approximately 3 hours later you will come to the big mid canyon rappel. There are bolts here but they are in poor condition (as with all bolts in this canyon). The next rappel is immediately after from a bush under a small alcove. Continuing downstream you are now in the narrowest, wettest, hardest part of the canyon. Everything in this section can be downclimbed or partner assisted by the skilled. After about 1 hour of this the canyon opens up again for the final sequence of rappels. The next rappel is from bolts on the south (right) after a field of poison ivy, which can be avoided using a little caution. The final rappel is immediately below from a couple of bolts in the watercourse. The final rappel is nothing less than spectacular. It deposits you in a beautifully sculpted alcove with lush greenery and running water (N37° 34' 29\", W110° 52' 28\"). After spending some time in the alcove, bushwhack your way down canyon through a narrow channel of willows and poison ivy for about 30 minutes until you come to Halls Creek and the point where you began the ascent earlier in the day. The alcove is a great place to escape the heat and desert of Halls Creek and the Waterpocket Fold for an afternoon, it's worth the hike through the willows and poison ivy to reach a great place to hang out. Optional Burr Trail Approach Route: Recently it has become popular to access Halls Creek by what is known as the Burr Trail Route. This route is only suggested for those with expert navigation and route finding skills. There is no trail and you will be navigating cross country for approximately 5 miles. Hiking from the Burr Trail Road to your camp at Millers Creek requires 4 to 5 hours. From Ticaboo, Utah drive south on Highway 276 for 7.0 miles to a junction with the paved Burr Trail Road (N37° 34' 32\", W110° 42' 43\"). Turn west (right) on to the paved Burr Trail Road. Follow the paved Burr Trail Road for 6.9 miles to where you can pull out and park on some slickrock, this is the Burr Trail Trailhead (N37° 36' 59\", W110° 47' 55\"). The trailhead is not signed and is nothing more than a spot you can pull off the road. From the trailhead you want to take a compass heading (GPS heading) to your eventual camp at Millers Creek. This is just to get you hiking in the correct west south-west direction. Your first obstacle is to cross Long Canyon but it is shallow and not difficult. Approximately 3 miles after leaving the trailhead you will want a navigational point (N37° 35' 47\", W110° 50' 25\") to aim for, This is the large letter \"H\" on the USGS map. Crossing this navigational point will keep you from straying into more difficult terrain. From the navigational point it is 1 1/2 miles to the break in the top of the Entrada sandstone (N37° 35' 25\", W110° 51' 45\") that allows access to Halls Creek. Once you get to the access through the upper cliff band it is a short downclimb to the valley floor. The route is moderately easy to figure out and is often cairned. If you get to a point that is difficult or requires a rope you are off route, stop and look around for an easier route. You should encounter nothing more than 3rd class scrambling. Once you are below the initial cliff band you want to traverse north 250-yards to a debris slide that allows you to safely descend to the valley floor and intersect Halls Creek (N37° 35' 32\", W110° 52' 01\"). Once you intersect Halls Creek you can hike south to base camp at Millers Creek. Optional Lake Powell Approach Route: Happy Dog can be accessed from Halls Creek Bay on Lake Powell. This approach is shorter and easier, but requires a boat to access. When approaching from Halls Creek Bay the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/happydog.htm 1/25/2018 Happy Dog - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 4 of 4 hike in will be approximately 5 miles, depending on the level of Lake Powell. The approach shrinks to a manageable 3 1/2 miles when the lake is at full pool. Halls Creek Narrows: Hiking through Halls Creek Narrows is an option for those looking for a little more action in the area. The narrows are normally completed as part of the hike in or out of Halls Creek.

To open Pandora's Box means to unwittingly unleash chaos on yourself and those around you. At least that is the Greek myth. In canyoneering terms Pandora's Box is possibly the best Wingate sandstone slot canyon on the Colorado Plateau. The canyon is not for beginners and provides a large combination of various problems to solve before releasing its grasp. Even after escaping the confines of the constriction you are presented with a final task to accomplish. General Information: Pandora's Box is a fun and complex technical slot canyon. The problems are interesting and moderately difficult to solve with a little thought. This canyon is not suitable for beginners. Intermediate and advanced canyoneers will be challenged by this route. Pandora's Box requires complete technical gear. The canyon is accessible year round but summer would be miserably hot. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 10 to 12 hours. The canyon is easily divided into three sections which are, the approach, the slot, and the exit. The approach will require approximately 2 hours. The slot will require approximately 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours depending on your skills and party size. The exit hike will require 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hours of hiking through charming canyon country. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Twin Rocks\" are essential. Navigation for this route can be difficult. All waypoints and maps for Pandora's Box use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The longest rappel in the canyon is 145-feet. The route requires two 150-foot ropes. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. In normal conditions this canyon might require minor knee to waist deep wading. A wetsuit is not required or recommended in normal conditions. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which is not difficult in this canyon. Note there are two exits for this canyon. The Chimney Rock Exit is the preferred exit and is highly advised for those attempting this route for the first time. The Meeks Mesa Exit is for expert canyoneers that have completed Pandora's Box before. Because of a high number of search and rescues, the rangers at Capitol Reef discourage first timers or novice from attempting the Meeks Mesa Exit unless they have consulted with them first. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/pandora.htm 1/25/2018 Pandora's Box - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 Warning: Pandora's Box is rated 3A R IV using the Canyon Rating System. Large frame canyoneers will have a difficult time descending Pandora's Box. My chest measurement is 43\" of solid muscle. I found it necessary to climb up and over obstacles that Smurf sized canyoneers could squeeze through. If you have moderate climbing ability and help from friends you should not get trapped in this canyon if you are my size or slightly larger. Large frame canyoneers will have to work much harder than Smurf sized canyoneers to descend this route. Most of the squeeze obstacles can be defeated by climbing up and over them. Bring as small of pack as possible. You have been warned! A major key to success with this slot canyon is to be hiking at first light or a little before. Many of the problems and rescues associated with this slot canyon are the result of canyoneers falling behind schedule for any number of reasons and running out of daylight. Don't be one of those canyoneers. So once again, You have been warned! Trailhead Information: This route can be completed with and without a shuttle vehicle. Using a shuttle vehicle is the preferred method and makes your day a little easier. To reach the Chimney Rock Trailhead from the Capitol Reef Visitor Center take Highway 24 west for 3.1 miles to the signed Chimney Rock Trailhead located at mile marker 76.3. The trailhead has parking for a dozen vehicles and a pit toilet. The Chimney Rock Trailhead is where you leave your shuttle vehicle. From the Chimney Rock Trailhead continue west on Highway 24 for 3.3 miles to mile marker 73. 50-yards west of mile marker 73 is a good dirt road heading north. Follow the dirt road for 0.1 miles to its end. This is the Meeks Mesa Trailhead and where the route begins for those with and without a shuttle vehicle. Any vehicle can easily access both trailheads. All roads are paved with the exception of the final 200-yards. A bicycle shuttle is manageable if a second vehicle is not available. There are several nice primitive campsites next to the Meeks Mesa Trailhead, the only problem with camping at the trailhead is you are close to the road and its not exactly quite. Help keep the area clean, please use the pit toilet at Chimney Rock if you feel the need to drop a duce. Route Information: Beginning at Meeks Mesa Trailhead (N38° 19' 41\", W111° 21' 57\") a stock trail begins at the east end of the parking area. The stock trail is extremely easy to locate if it was freshly utilized. However, if it has rained or not been used recently the stock trail can be difficult to find and follow. From the trailhead, follow the stock trail northeast as it climbs to the wide bench above the valley floor but below the major cliff band. Once on the bench follow the stock trail northwest as it follows the wide bench below the cliff band. Approximately 2 miles from the trailhead the stock trail doubles back to the southeast and climbs through a cleft in the cliff band to the top of Meeks Mesa (N38° 20' 35\", W111° 22' 07\"). This stock trail is still used by horses, if you are forced to start scrambling you are probably not on the correct route. Evidence abounds of the drilling and blasting used to create the stock trail. As you climb to the top of the mesa its interesting to ponder the trails construction. The stock trail disappears at the top of the mesa and route finding becomes a cross-country affair. From the top of the cleft travel 3/4 miles northeast until you intersect Pandora's Box. The canyon consists of two upper forks with the north fork being the better choice. Route find to the top of the north fork of Pandora's Box (N38° 21' 07\", W111° 21' 40\"). The technical section begins with a 10-foot downclimb followed by a 60-foot rappel anchored by a marginally wedged stump. This is quickly followed by an 85-foot two-stage rappel anchored by a chokestone. Soon followed by a 15-foot rappel anchored from a chokestone. This section of canyon contains a couple of interesting problems to solve, one of which is perhaps the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/pandora.htm 1/25/2018 Pandora's Box - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 canyons most difficult obstacle and is located just below the entry rappels. You must physically chimney 20-feet up the canyon walls to get above a pinch, and than you must chimney 40-feet down canyon to cross above the pinch. The canyon then opens up and is a stroll until the junction with the south fork. Walk up the south fork and check it out if you wish. From the junction of the north and south fork the canyon becomes a physical and challenging thrill ride as you head downstream. You will encounter one mandatory rappel of 15- feet before reaching the finishing sequence. Depending on your skills; you will be forced to use additional rappels, belays, partner assists and handlines to descend the canyon. In the canyon you will encounter numerous and varying problems. Several sections of slot are too narrow for big guys to squeeze through and they will be forced to climb up and over the constriction. The key to making the tight sections easier is to go high early and stay high whenever in doubt. The slot exit is two-staged and is as glorious as any exit around. The canyon exits by rappelling 50-feet to a big platform in the watercourse. The rappel is anchored from a medium size tree. The second part of the rappel is 145-feet to the canyon floor and is anchor by an assortment of items. In other words, a real rats nest consisting of several solid anchors. From the base of the exit rappel a short section of boulder hopping deposits you in Chimney Rock Canyon (N38° 21' 16\", W111° 20' 24\"). Now its time to pay for the sin of opening Pandora's Box. At this point you will be presented with two options. For those who left a shuttle vehicle at the Chimney Rock Trailhead turn east (right) for the preferred Chimney Rock Exit. For those without a shuttle vehicle turn west (left), for the more difficult Meeks Mesa Exit. Chimney Rock Exit (Preferred): Stroll downstream (east) 5 3/4 miles to where Chimney Rock Canyon joins Spring Canyon (N38° 19' 52\", W111° 15' 50\"). During the cooler months you will usually find a small amount of flowing water in this section of canyon. From the confluence of Chimney Rock Canyon and Spring Canyon hike downstream for 1/2 mile to a signed junction with a major drainage entering from the west (N38° 19' 27\", W111° 15' 49\"). Do not continue to follow Spring Canyon as it snakes eastward. Turn west (right) and hike 1 1/2 miles up the major drainage toward the Chimney Rock Loop Trail. Near the top of the major drainage you will encounter a signed junction (N38° 19' 01\", W111° 17' 10\"). The trail to the east (left) loops along the Mummy Cliff, take the trail heading west (right). Follow the trail for 3/4 mile to a second junction signed Chimney Rock Loop Trail (N38° 19' 03\", W111° 17' 53\"). Continue following the maintained trail west 1/2 mile and descend the hill to the Chimney Rock Trailhead (N38° 18' 54\", W111° 18' 16\"). Meeks Mesa Exit (Expert Only): Hike upstream (west) for 1 3/4 miles, through a short section of shallow narrows, to where the first reasonable weakness exists (N38° 21' 35\", W111° 21' 57\") in the Wingate Sandstone to the south (left). Choose your route carefully and climb back to the top of Meeks Mesa. If you encounter any exposed or difficult climbing during the exit, make a note that your route finding skills suck, and then look around for an easier route. Once you are back on top of the mesa head south and intersect the stock trail you climbed earlier in the day that first delivered you to the top of Mesa Mesa. Greek Mythology: In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman on earth. Zeus ordered Hephaestus, the god of craftsmanship, to create her and he did, using water and earth. The gods endowed her with many talents; Aphrodite gave her beauty, Apollo music, Hermes persuasion, and so forth. Hence her name: Pandora, \"all-gifted\". When Prometheus stole fire from heaven, Zeus took vengeance by presenting Pandora to Epimetheus, Prometheus' brother. With her, Pandora had a box that she was not to open under any circumstance. Impelled by her natural curiosity, Pandora opened the box, and all evil contained escaped and spread over the earth. She hastened to close the lid, but the whole contents of the box had escaped, except for one thing which lay at the bottom, and that was Hope. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/pandora.htm 1/25/2018 Pandora's Box - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 4 of 4 Related Link: Opening Pandora's Box - Interesting and detailed story of a canyoneering rescue.

This canyon is suitable for experienced and physically fit canyoneers only. The route is often combined with other canyons in the area to create a multi-day backpack trip. This route visits an isolated section of the Waterpocket Fold on the periphery of Capital Reef National Park. Warning: If you attempt this canyon, every member of your group must be a highly skilled canyoneer and rock climber. This canyon is deadly for beginners. Poe Canyon is NOT suitable for the general canyoneering public and is rated 4B X V using the Canyon Rating System. Errors in technique or judgment will likely result in serious injury or death. Do not underestimate the difficulty and danger of descending this canyon. If you can not escape the many keeper potholes you will be trapped. This canyon is extremely remote. A rescue in this canyon would be hazardous, time consuming and extremely troublesome. You have been warned! General Information: Poe Canyon is a technical canyoneering route that requires complete technical gear and experience. A backcountry permit is not required for this route as you are camping just outside of Capitol Reef National Park. Spring and fall are the preferred times of year to attempt this route. The route is brutally hot in summer. The route is divided into two parts, the approach to camp at Millers Creek, and the actual Poe Canyon route itself. The approach to your camp requires an 8 1/2 mile hike down Halls Creek, over Halls Divide, to Millers Creek. There is no water to pump for the first 5 miles. It will take approximately 6 to 8 hours to reach your camp at Millers Creek. The Poe Canyon technical canyoneering route will require approximately 12 to 14 hours to complete starting and ending at camp on Millers Creek. This canyon requires a very long day, the key to success is to be hiking at first light and bringing talented partners. The route requires two 60-meter (195-foot) ropes. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100-feet of webbing, several rapid links, a pair of bat hooks (BD Talons), a pair of étriers, several potshots, complete pothole escape gear, and a prusik system. This canyon contains bolted rappel anchors that are ancient and in poor condition. You might be forced to construct your own anchors or replace existing anchors so go prepared. The canyon contains difficult climbing. All members of your party should have the ability to climb 5.7 or better. There are at least a dozen rappels from a combination of natural and bolted anchors, with the longest rappel being 185-feet. The canyon contains unavoidable water which will require wading and swimming. Wetsuits are advised on all but the warmest days. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/poe.htm 1/25/2018 Poe Canyon - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 Keep a careful watch as there are several sections of poison ivy along the route. Navigation for this route is challenging; a GPS is a highly advised. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Deer Point\", \"Stevens Canyon North\", and \"Halls Mesa\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. On the approach to camp at Miller Creek you will follow a combination of game trails, old wagon road and streambed. The technical portion of the route contains no trails and nearly the entire approach is on slickrock. The route finding at the head of the canyon is extremely convoluted with a maze of fins and small buttes. Good route finding skills are required. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. The drainage is short and a clear view of the western sky is available on the approach. Check the local weather report before committing. Trailhead Information: Poe Canyon does not require a vehicle shuttle. The trailhead is accessible to passenger cars in normal conditions. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Not all roads described are shown on the USGS map. From Ticaboo, Utah drive south on Highway 276 for 7.0 miles to a junction with the paved Burr Trail Road (N37° 34' 32\", W110° 42' 43). Turn west (right) on to the paved Burr Trail Road. Follow the paved Burr Trail Road 18.5 miles to a dirt road and a small wood sign that reads \"Halls Creek Overlook\" (N37° 44' 47\", W110 ° 54' 33\"). Turn west (Left) and follow the dirt road 5.0 miles to a junction (N37° 41' 17\", W110° 54' 43\"). Turn west (right) and follow the dirt road 0.4 to a bend in the road (N37° 40' 59\", W110° 54' 35\"). passenger cars might want to park here. Those with a high clearance vehicle keep following the dirt road to the west 0.6 miles to the Airstrip Trailhead. There is no water at the Trailhead. Some refer to the Airstrip Trailhead as the \"Short Cut\", this is because the Halls Creek Trailhead suggested by the National Park Service begins at the Halls Creek Overlook. The Short Cut trims over 5-miles of slogging off your route in both directions. The penalty for taking the Short Cut is the route from canyon rim to canyon floor requires moderate route finding skills. The first pumpable water is 5.0 miles down Halls Creek, after Halls Divide. Approach Hike Information: From the Airstrip Trailhead (N37° 40' 41\", W110° 54' 53) hike west and down to the obvious break in the cliff band. Work your way through the cliff band and start descending the steep exposed drainage, trending to your south (left) to avoid the cliffs below you. Do not under estimate this descent. It is steep and loose, finishing 1000-feet below you on a game trail (N37° 40' 27\", W110° 55' 14\"). Turn south (left) on the game trail and follow it for 4 miles to Halls Creek Divide (N37° 37' 43\", W110° 52' 57\"). The trail weaves in and out of the wash several times in this first 4 miles, but mostly follows the benches on the east (left) side of Halls Creek to Halls Creek Divide. After Halls Creek Divide continue hiking south down Halls Creek for 4 miles. The game trail occasionally follows an old wagon road and meanders across Halls Creek several times, but generally stays on the benches to the west (right) of Halls Creek for the last 3 miles to Millers Creek (N37° 34' 37\", W110° 52' 10\"). The game trail is unreliable. It disappears and reappears randomly. It is an unofficial trail and is not marked or maintained. Millers Creek has respectable camping with shade and good pumpable water. It also makes for a good base camp to complete additional routes in the area. Route Information: From Millers Creek hike south 1 1/4 miles down Halls Creek to the bottom of Poe Canyon (N37° 33' 38\", W110° 52' 07\"). This is the start of the canyon approach. At this point you will be ascending 1000-feet up the Waterpocket Fold on slickrock to the head of Poe Canyon. The approach is up the north (right) side of the canyon. Try not to follow the rim too closely on the approach as the canyon meanders a bit. About half way up you will cross a http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/poe.htm 1/25/2018 Poe Canyon - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 tributary (N37° 33' 36\", W110° 52' 47\") of Poe on the approach hike. Continue hiking up working your way through a maze of fins and small buttes until you arrive at the first rappel (N37° 33' 23\", W110° 53' 12\"), which will allow you access to the canyon bottom. The rappel is 185-feet and is anchor by a sling around a couple large rocks. Total approach time from Millers Creek to the first rappel is approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Once in the canyon bottom head downstream and let the show begin. Potholes are the name of the game and they begin almost immediately. Expect to spend 10 to 11 hours thrashing through this canyon until it releases you at the finish. Teamwork is the key to maneuvering fast and efficient. Partner assists, shoulder stands and pack tosses will all be used. Leapfrogging team members from obstacle to obstacle will increase your chances of escaping before nightfall. The canyon has a little bit of everything, small rappels, large rappels, keeper potholes, downclimbs, antique bolted anchors, no anchors, stemming, swimming and wading. But mostly it has potholes, some are full, some are empty and some are in-between. The five major potholes have become known as the \"5 Pits of Poe\". Pit 1 - Rappel into possible water filled pit with slanted up-climb on downstream side. A little challenging because of mud, but not to difficult. Pit 2 - Rappel into a pit with no rappel anchor and swim under a cool natural bridge. Pit 3 - Rappel from a deadman into a swimming pothole that is difficult to escape from. Pit 4 - Is better known as the \"Pit of Despair\", this is the big one you have heard so much about, this is the crux of the route. The pothole is 25-feet across and it's 30-feet to the bottom of the pit. The downstream side has 15 to 20-feet of nearly flat sandstone. If attempting to bypass this obstacle with a pack toss or potshot it's good to know you will have to toss 40 plus feet from an awkward throwing stance. Your other option is no better. High on the south (right) canyon wall are two bolts with hangers and some hook holes that were placed in 1981, they are ancient. The first bolt is above the entrance crack and the second is centered over the Pit. The idea is to get a rope on the first bolt, and use that bolt as protection to get a rope on the second bolt. Once that is accomplished you can setup a small pendulum to bypass the pit. Pit 5 - Is better known as the \"Wart Pit\", and is locate not far downstream from the Pit of Despair. This is your last major obstacle. The Wart is only 10-feet across but its approximately 40-feet deep. The sandstone on the downstream side is flat. The Wart is bypassed by using a small flake or \"wart\" of stone high on the north (left) canyon wall. The wart is about the size of a couple basketballs. In the past canyoneers have slung the wart and used it to rappel/traverse/swing across to the far side of the pothole. The difficulty is there is little to keep the sling from sliding off the wart, and God only knows how strong the wart really is. Following the Wart you have a 30-foot rappel followed by a 140-foot rappel into the lower canyon. The lower canyon contains poison ivy and involves a short bushwhack to get back to Halls Creek. The hike back to your camp at Millers Creek will require 30 to 45 minutes. Optional Burr Trail Approach Route: Recently it has become popular to access Halls Creek by what is known as the Burr Trail Route. This route is only suggested for those with expert navigation and route finding skills. There is no trail and you will be navigating cross country for approximately 5 miles. Hiking from the Burr Trail Road to your camp at Millers Creek requires 4 to 5 hours. From Ticaboo, Utah drive south on Highway 276 for 7.0 miles to a junction with the paved Burr Trail Road (N37° 34' 32\", W110° 42' 43\"). Turn west (right) on to the paved Burr Trail http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/poe.htm 1/25/2018 Poe Canyon - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 4 of 4 Road. Follow the paved Burr Trail Road for 6.9 miles to where you can pull out and park on some slickrock, this is the Burr Trail Trailhead (N37° 36' 59\", W110° 47' 55\"). The trailhead is not signed and is nothing more than a spot you can pull off the road. From the trailhead you want to take a compass heading (GPS heading) to your eventual camp at Millers Creek. This is just to get you hiking in the correct west south-west direction. Your first obstacle is to cross Long Canyon but it is shallow and not difficult. Approximately 3 miles after leaving the trailhead you will want a navigational point (N37° 35' 47\", W110° 50' 25\") to aim for, This is the large letter \"H\" on the USGS map. Crossing this navigational point will keep you from straying into more difficult terrain. From the navigational point it is 1 1/2 miles to the break in the top of the Entrada sandstone (N37° 35' 25\", W110° 51' 45\") that allows access to Halls Creek. Once you get to the access through the upper cliff band it is a short downclimb to the valley floor. The route is moderately easy to figure out and is often cairned. If you get to a point that is difficult or requires a rope you are off route, stop and look around for an easier route. You should encounter nothing more than 3rd class scrambling. Once you are below the initial cliff band you want to traverse north 250-yards to a debris slide that allows you to safely descend to the valley floor and intersect Halls Creek (N37° 35' 32\", W110° 52' 01\"). Once you intersect Halls Creek you can hike south to base camp at Millers Creek. Optional Lake Powell Approach Route: Happy Dog can be accessed from Halls Creek Bay on Lake Powell. This approach is shorter and easier, but requires a boat to access. When approaching from Halls Creek Bay the hike in will be approximately 5 miles, depending on the level of Lake Powell. The approach shrinks to a manageable 3 1/2 miles when the lake is at full pool. Halls Creek Narrows: Hiking through Halls Creek Narrows is an option for those looking for a little more action in the area. The narrows are normally completed as part of the hike in or out of Halls Creek. Canyon Name: Because of the routes five major pits the canyon was named \"Poe\", after Edgar Allen Poe's short story \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". In the story a prisoner, during the Spanish Inquisition, finds himself in a dark room, with a blade like pendulum slowly descending towards his chest. Though he escapes the pendulum, the walls of the room close in on him, pushing him closer to falling into a deep pit in the middle of the room.

Feedback ] [ Updates ] Sheets Gulch Capitol Reef National Park Canyoneering In the distant past the earth in the Capitol Reef area underwent tremendous horizontal compression. Unbelievable forces pushed solid rock upward for thousands of feet until it bent back upon itself in a tremendous fold. The folded layers of rock formed a nearly impenetrable reef almost 80 miles long. Streams that often carry water only a few hours each year cut through and across the raised beds of rock, carving a labyrinthine series of canyons almost a thousand feet deep and in places only two feet wide. These deep, narrow canyons, cutting across the folded rocks, provide some of the best slot canyon hikes in the world. General Information: Sheets Gulch is an adventure the entire family can enjoy. The route visits a massive jug handle arch that I have never seen mentioned anywhere else. My children call it Elephant Arch for reasons obvious to those who have seen it and possess an imagination. Sheets Gulch is a great introduction into the sport of canyoneering. The canyon contains only minor obstacles. Experienced hikers will have no problems in this canyon. Novice hikers will need to help each other over a couple of minor obstacles. You will likely encounter knee deep wading and mud in several short sections of slots after recent rainstorms. Normally the canyon is dry but go prepared. Total time required for a complete round trip is 4 to 5 hours. The trip can be shortened or lengthened with various options to suit your desires. A vehicle shuttle is not required for this out and back route. Navigation for this route is easy. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and in locating Elephant Arch. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Sandy Creek Benches\" and \"Bear Canyon\" are helpful. Sheets Gulch is rated 2A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a huge flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Trailhead Information: From the Capitol Reef Visitor Center take Highway 24 east for 9.1 miles to mile marker 88.9 and the signed Notom-Bullfrog turn-off. Turn south at the intersection and follow the Notom-Bullfrog Road for 13.0 miles to the point where Sheets Gulch crosses the road (N38° 06' 53\", W111° 04' 14\"). The crossing is signed. The road is paved for the first 10.3 miles to the Wayne County line. The remainder of the road to Sheets Gulch is a well-maintained gravel road. All vehicles can easily access the point where Sheets Gulch crosses the Notom-Bullfrog Road. This is where most passenger vehicles will need to park. Four wheel drive and high clearance vehicles (HCV) can drive west up the sandy and rocky bottom of Sheets Gulch for 0.7 miles. A reasonable parking area out of flash flood danger is located under an old cottonwood tree. This is the Trailhead (N38° 06' 28\", W111° 04' 45\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sheets.htm 1/25/2018 Sheets Gulch - Capitol Reef - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Route Information: From the Sheets Gulch Trailhead (N38° 06' 28\", W111° 04' 45\") begin hiking west up the obvious wash. 1/4 mile from the trailhead you will encounter a junction (N38° 06' 23\", W111° 04' 48\"), take the south (left) fork and continue hiking. 1/4 miles beyond the first junction you will encounter a second junction (N38° 06' 16\", W111° 04' 59\"), take the north (right) fork. From this point on the fun really begins as the canyon slots up almost immediately into an amusing little section of narrows. As you hike up canyon keep your eyes peeled for petrified wood, the canyon is loaded with it. Approximately 3/4 mile above the second junction the canyon enters one of its narrowest sections. The canyon walls will be about 3 feet wide and you will encounter a couple of minor chokestones that you must climb over. It is through this section that you are most likely to experience several pools of knee deep water. 1 3/4 miles above the second junction you will encounter a really awesome arch on the north wall of the canyon (N38° 06' 10\", W111° 06' 23\"). This type of arch is often referred to as a jug handle arch. My kids think the arch looks like an elephant head as you approach it. The arch is easily visible from the bottom of the canyon as you approach it, but it is not visible when you are standing directly beneath it in the canyon bottom. If you hike up canyon to a point just beyond the bottom of the arch there is a low spot in the wall (N38° 06' 08\", W111° 06' 23\") where it is easy to scramble out of the canyon bottom and hike up and through the arch if you desire. Some groups might consider visiting the arch and returning a reasonable adventure that will require 3 to 4 hours. For those wanting to see more the canyon remains fun and interesting for an additional 1 3/4 mile. Just keep hiking up canyon and you will see more of the same only different. For those attempting the complete section of narrows you will know you have reached the turn around point when you encounter the truly strange. You will be hiking up canyon, round a corner, the canyon will open up considerably and the north canyon wall will contain numerous stands of Douglas Fir. The trees are growing along the cool, shaded south canyon wall. At this point the canyon walls begin to change from white Navajo Sandstone to red Wingate Sandstone. This is the usual turn-around point (N38° 06' 08\", W111° 07' 35\"). Return the way that you came. Optional Route Information: Sheets Gulch can be hiked completely through the reef with a vehicle shuttle. The route requires 7 to 8 hours. The shuttle is long, rough and time consuming. The route is rated 2A III using the Canyon Rating System. Those attempting this optional route will access the canyon from the Tantalus Flats Trailhead located on the South Draw Road. Optional Trailhead Information: The optional route described requires a four wheel drive or high clearance vehicle. From the Capitol Reef Visitor Center follow the paved Scenic Drive south into the park for 7.9 miles to the end of the pavement. When the pavement ends the road splits with the Left Fork heading into Capitol Gorge and the Right Fork heading toward Pleasant Creek. Take the Right Fork signed Pleasant Creek and follow the main dirt road south for an additional 2.8 miles to Pleasant Creek. Drive across Pleasant Creek and continue south on the unmaintained South Draw Road for 5.6 miles. The trailhead is located at the point where Sheets Gulch crosses the South Draw Road (N38° 07' 29\", W111° 11' 47\"). This trailhead might be easier to reach from Lower Bowns Reservoir accessed from Highway 12, but I have never attempted it from that direction. The route to access the Tantalus Flats Trailhead described above is really poor and extremely time consuming.

The route has just enough spice tossed in to keep the quest interesting and fun. General Information: Stegosaur Slot is a fun and stimulating technical slot canyon. This canyon is suitable for beginners with advanced leadership. Stegosaur Slot is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System and requires complete technical gear. The canyon is accessible year round but the route would be treacherous with snow on the ground. If attempting the route in summer get an early start so you can hike to the top in the cool morning air. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 4 to 5 hours. The route is easily divided into three sections which are, the approach, the slot, and the exit. The approach will require approximately 2 hours. The slot will require approximately 1 hour. The exit hike will require 1 hour to return to the trailhead. Large or inexperienced groups will take longer so plan accordingly. The longest rappel in the canyon is 115-feet. The route requires two 120-foot ropes. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. In normal conditions Stegosaur Slot is dry, in wet conditions you might encounter minor ankle to knee deep wading. A wetsuit should never be required for this route. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Fruita\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Stegosaur Slot use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a minimal flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. Stegosaur Slot contains a reasonably long narrow section of slot. Large frame canyoneers should never become trapped or stuck, but the larger you are the more you will have to fight through the narrows. I am not a smurf sized canyoneer and I was able to traverse the entire narrows by remaining on the canyon floor. You can always climb up in this slot to gain a little more width if required. I have seen pictures of canyoneers high stemming in this slot and that is not a requirement as you should never be forced more than a couple feet off the canyon floor. Because of the extended section of narrow slot a long sleeve shirt and long pants are advised for those that wish to save a little skin squeezing through. Trailhead Information: To reach the trailhead from the Capitol Reef Visitor Center take Highway 24 east for 2.0 miles to the signed Hickman Bridge Trailhead located at mile marker 81.1. The trailhead is located on the north side of Highway 24 just before a bridge over the Fremont River. The trailhead consists of a large paved parking area, kiosk and a pit toilet. Any vehicle can access this trailhead and all roads are paved. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/stegosaur.htm 1/25/2018 Stegosaur Slot - Capitol Reef National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Route Information: From the Hickman Bridge Trailhead (N38° 17' 19\", W111° 13' 42\"), the trail follows the north bank of the Fremont River downstream a short distance and than begins to switchback up the Kayenta sandstone. At the top of the switchbacks you will notice a short trail branching to the right (east). This trail extends 30-yards to the remnants of a Fremont Culture pit house. The pit house foundation is identified by the ring of large black rocks. Continuing hiking up the main trail and you will soon come to a signed junction (N38° 17' 22\", W111° 13' 35\"). The trail to the left (west) leads to Hickman Bridge. Take the right (north) fork signed Rim Overlook/Navajo Knobs. From the junction the trail leads over a small rise and crosses a wash. After crossing the wash the trail leads west following a sandstone ledge system. 1/2 mile beyond the Hickman Bridge/Rim Overlook junction you will encounter the Hickman Bridge Viewpoint (N38° 17' 30\", W111° 13' 56\"). This viewpoint offers an interesting examination of Hickman Bridge from above. From the viewpoint just keep following the well- defined trail west for another 1 1/2 miles to the Rim Overlook (N38° 17' 28\", W111° 14' 58\"). From the viewpoint enjoy the scene spread out below you. From the Rim Overlook continue following the trail northwest towards Navajo Knobs. After hiking 1/4 mile the trail makes a sharp bend around the head of a wash (N38° 17' 40\", W111° 14' 58\"), this is where you leave the Navajo Knobs Trail and begin hiking north up the wash bottom. There is an emerging use trail developing along the wash, please try to stay on the use trail or in the wash bottom to avoid the cryptobiotic soil that is prevalent in this area. From here on up you will begin to catch an occasional glimpse of the sharks fin to your east that dominates the ridge. After leaving the Navajo Knobs Trail continue hiking up he wash bottom for 1/3 mile to where a large dead tree (N38° 17' 57\", W111° 14' 53\") is located in the middle of the wash. The large dead tree is where you escape the canyon bottom. To escape the canyon bottom use the ledges and cracks on the east wall to climb out. The route out is easier than it first appears. If you encounter anything more difficult than minor scrambling or minor exposure look around for an easier alternative and realize you are not very good at route finding. As you near the top of the slope the impressive sharks fin comes into full view. Contour around the south end of the sharks fin and climb to the top of a minor saddle (N38° 17' 52\", W111° 14' 38\"). From the top of the minor saddle traverse north along the sandstone ledge for 300-yards to the entrance rappel to Stegosaur Slot (N38° 18' 00\", W111° 14' 37\"). The rappel is 110-feet and the anchor consists of two easy to locate bolts. From here on down it's impossible to get lost. Just follow the canyon south and head downstream. You will encounter a couple of minor downclimbs and one mediocre downclimb in this section that some might prefer to handline or rappel. For those wanting to rappel the drop is 20-feet and anchored from a tree on the east canyon wall. Just after the mediocre downclimb the canyon makes a sharp 90-degree bend to the east and immediately narrows up into an impressive slot. Continue downstream and enjoy the show as you squeeze your way through. The slot ends abruptly on a wide ledge above your final rappel (N38° 17' 52\", W111° 14' 23\"). The rappel is 100-feet and is anchored from a small tree. Please do a good job of extending your anchors to avoid rope grooves in this area. Standing back as far as possible when pulling your ropes will also help. From the base of the final rappel hike and boulder hop down canyon keeping your eyes to the (west) right for a use trail that makes the hike out much easier. It's 1/2 mile from the base of the final rappel until you intersect (N38° 17' 37\", W111° 14' 08\") the Rim Overlook Trail you hiked up earlier in the day. Return to the trailhead. Full Meal Deal: Stegosaurs Slot is often combined with the short hike to Hickman Natural Bridge. The side trip to visit the bridge only adds about 30 minutes to the route and is well worth the effort. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/stegosaur.htm 1/25/2018 Stegosaur Slot - Capitol Reef National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 Video: Enjoy a short entertaining video of a trip through Stegosaur Slot Canyon.

Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Cheesebox Canyon Cedar Mesa Technical Canyoneering Cheesebox is a appetizing canyon with beautifully sculpted narrows. The charm of this route is that much of it can be downclimbed or rappelled, depending on your skill and risk tolerance. The slot is dramatic; the narrows are deep, attractive and fun. Cheesebox is consider to be one of the must do classics. General Information: Cheesebox is an exceptional canyon that requires complete technical gear. Cheesebox is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required form Upper Trailhead to Lower Trailhead is approximately 6 hours. Add one hour if you do not have a shuttle. In normal conditions this canyon contains wading and swimming. The water levels in Cheesebox fluctuate over a wide range depending on recent weather conditions. A wetsuit is essential during colder weather. During hot summer months a wetsuit is not required for the warm blooded. In drier conditions the water can become putrid. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"The Cheesebox\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Cheesebox use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a large drainage and has a high flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. A 100-foot rope is required to complete the route. The longest rappel in the canyon is less then 50-feet. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the obstacles can be downclimb instead of rappelled. The Cedar Mesa area is considered a bolt free environment. Please do your best to preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. The problem solving involved with using natural anchors and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: A high clearance vehicle is required for accessing this trailhead. The road is suitable for two-wheel drives during normal conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required for this route, but using a second vehicle or mountain bike will eliminate one hour of road walking. From Blanding, Utah: Travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel 55 miles west on Utah Highway 95 to mile marker 66.5. The Cheesebox Road is located on the north side of the highway. From Hanksville, Utah: Travel south on Utah Highway 95 for 66 miles to mile marker 66.5. The Cheesebox Road is located on the north side of the highway. Cheesebox Road: Is officially designated San Juan County Road 2271 and begins on the north side of Utah Highway 95 at mile marker 66.5. This is also the location of the \"Soldier's Grave\" (N37° 41' 05\", W110° 13' 12\"). Follow the Cheesebox Road for 8.2 miles to the Lower Cheesebox Trailhead. The Lower http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/cheesebox.htm 1/25/2018 Cheesebox Canyon - Cedar Mesa - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Trailhead is identified as an open area of slickrock. This is where you leave your shuttle vehicle. If you do not have a shuttle vehicle this is the best place to begin hiking from. From the Lower Trailhead continue following the Cheesebox road north for an additional 2.8 miles to the Upper Cheesebox Trailhead. There is no marked trail or trailhead. Just pull off the road at a convenient spot and park in the trees. The most difficult part of the Cheesebox Road is near the Soldier's Grave where the road crosses White Canyon. If you can get across White Canyon the remainder of the maintained dirt road should present no major problems in normal conditions. There are several primitive camp spots located along the Cheesebox Road. Camping near the Soldier's Grave is popular. For those desiring an improved campground I suggest camping at nearby Natural Bridges National Monument. The Soldier's Grave: In 1884 several cowboys got into a dispute with some Paiute Indians concerning the ownership of a horse. The cowboys called in the U.S. Cavalry to help them with the dispute. A chase ensued during which the Paiutes ambushed the soldiers and killed two of them. The Soldiers are buried at the marked grave just off highway 95. The Paiutes were never captured. Route Information: From the Upper Cheesebox Trailhead (N37° 42' 28\", W110° 04' 03\") hike east for 300 yards into a major side drainage. Hike down the drainage until you reach the first major dryfall. You could rappel this 80-foot dryfall if you so desire, but the standard route follows the east (left) side of the major side drainage approximately 1/4 mile to a weakness in the sandstone layers that allows you to downclimb to the canyon bottom. Once in the canyon bottom just continue downstream to the junction of the major side drainage and the West Fork of Cheesebox Canyon (N37° 41' 59\", W110° 03' 43\"). The main event begins the moment you begin down the West Fork of Cheesebox Canyon. The canyon has a rhythm of narrows followed by an open area followed by more narrows. The suspense builds like a good movie as each successive narrows is better then the previous. In this section of canyon you will probably find wading and possible swimming. It is in this section of canyon that you will also encounter four major obstacles. Most will probably want to rappel these obstacles, all of which are less then 50-feet. Natural anchors are abundant. At least three of these obstacles can be downclimbed by the skilled, but the penalty points for screwing up are high. Soon you will encounter the East Fork of Cheesebox (N37° 41' 22\", W110° 04' 10\") entering from the east (left). You can hike up the East Fork as far as your skills allow. Below the East/West confluence you probably will not need your rope again, but you will almost certainly encounter at least one final swim. This section of canyon is sometimes referred to as \"the swimming pools\". After exiting the short swimming pool section the canyon opens up. Approximately 3/4 miles below the swimming pools you will encounter the first section of kiddie narrows. You can climb through them or climb around them. Approximately 1 mile below the first kiddie narrows you will encounter a second section of kiddie narrows. Climb through them or climb around them. At the end of the second section of kiddie narrows is the exit (N37° 40' 15\", W110° 05' 11\"). The exit is really the first place you can climb west out of Cheesebox Canyon. You must route find your way up through the layered sandstone. The first and most difficult cliff band is best defeated by hiking south along its base a couple hundred yards to where a ramp allows you to climb above the cliff band. From this point you can often find hiker made trails and cairns to help you puzzle your way up and out of the canyon. The route finding is not extremely difficult, but wrong turns can be time consuming. Paying attention and a little mental execution through this section came save time. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/cheesebox.htm 1/25/2018 Cheesebox Canyon - Cedar Mesa - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 After breaching the final cliff band hike northwest 1/4 mile to the Lower Cheesebox Trailhead (N37° 40' 24\", W110° 05' 37\"). Cryptobiotic Soil: This route crosses areas of cryptobiotic soil. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy decades of growth.

The canyon can be combined with several other slots in the area to create a fun day of canyoneering. General Information: Duckett Slot is best described as short and entertaining. This canyon is physical and part of the appeal of this slot is the climbing and teamwork involved. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 2 to 3 hours. Duckett Slot is rated 3B II using the Canyon Rating System. Duckett Slot requires complete technical gear. The longest rappel in the canyon is 35-feet and requires a 70-foot rope. Additional gear should consist of, several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system. During normal conditions you will encounter water that requires wading. Wetsuits are advised on all but the warmest days. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. The problem solving involved with using natural anchor and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. A GPS is helpful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Copper Point\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Duckett Slot use the WGS84 datum. This route has a minor flashflood danger. A quick look to the sky before entering this canyon should be sufficient. Trailhead Information: The actual trailhead is only 1.6 miles off the paved highway. It is simple to walk in if you don't have a high clearance vehicle. Those with a high clearance vehicle can drive right to the trailhead. A vehicle shuttle is not required for this route. Occasionally the road is suitable for two- wheel drives during normal conditions, depending on when it was graded last. From Blanding, Utah: Travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel 60 miles west on Utah Highway 95 to mile marker 60.9. This is known as \"Ducket Crossing\". From Hanksville, Utah: Travel south on Utah Highway 95 for 61 miles to mile marker 60.9. This is known as \"Ducket Crossing\". Ducket Crossing Road: Is officially designated San Juan County Road 2101. Exit Highway 95 on the west side and drive under the highway through the culvert. Follow the road east for 0.6 miles to a fork, take the north (left) fork. Drive an additional 1.0 miles and find a place to park. This is the Duckett Slot Trailhead. Route Information: From the Duckett Slot Trailhead (N37° 45' 22\", W110° 16' 05\"), hike northeast up the road for approximately 1/3 mile and then turn northwest (left) and hike 300-yards to the drainage known as Duckett Slot (N37° 45' 39\", W110° 15' 58\"). Follow the drainage downstream and it http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/duckett.htm 1/25/2018 Duckett Slot - Cedar Mesa - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 will soon slot up. You will encounter wading, downclimbing, a little stemming, 3 to 5 rappels and a handline or two depending on your downclimbing skills and tolerance to risk. The canyon ends at its confluence with White Canyon. Turn south (left) and hike up White Canyon, around a bend, and you will see a weakness (N37° 45' 21\", W110° 16' 25\") on the north (left) side of White Canyon. This is the exit. Escape to the canyon rim and hike back to the trailhead.

The route snakes through a long section of beautifully sculpted narrows and ends with a great view of some well preserved Anasazi cliff dwellings. There are no major difficulties with this adventure but good navigational skills are required. This is a very fun and entertaining canyon that can be enjoyed by competent canyoneers. General Information: Gravel Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon consists of several swims, wading, two rappels and plenty of fun scrambling and easy bouldering problems. Total time required for a round trip, including visiting the cliff dwellings is 7 to 8 hours. This is not a difficult route for a technical canyon, but solid skills are certainly required. Gravel Canyon requires complete technical gear. There are several swims and a wetsuit is essential during colder weather. A 100 foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, please do not bolt this canyon. The canyon is easy to descend using natural anchors. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"The Cheesebox\" are essential. Navigation for this route is difficult and requires several miles of route finding across open desert. All waypoints and maps for Gravel Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Gravel Canyon is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a high flash flood danger. Check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Trailhead Information: A high clearance vehicle is required for accessing this trailhead. The road is suitable for two wheel drives during normal conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required for this route. From Blanding, Utah: Travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel 55 miles west on Utah Highway 95 to mile marker 66.5. The Cheesebox Road is located on the north side of the highway. From Hanksville, Utah: Travel south on Utah Highway 95 for 66 miles to mile marker 66.5. The Cheesebox Road is located on the north side of the highway. Cheesebox Road: Is officially designated San Juan County Road 2271 and begins on the north side of Utah Highway 95 at mile marker 66.5. This is also the location of the \"Soldier's Grave\" (N37° 41' 05\", W110° 13' 12\"). Follow the Cheesebox Road for 12.0 miles to the trailhead. The most difficult part of the Cheesebox Road is near the Soldier's Grave where the road crosses White Canyon. If you can get across White Canyon the remainder of the maintained dirt road should present no major http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/gravel.htm 1/25/2018 Gravel Canyon - Cedar Mesa - Technical Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 problems in normal conditions. There is no marked trail or trailhead. Just pull off the road at a convenient spot and park in the trees. There are several primitive camp spots located along the Cheese Box Road. Camping near the Soldier's Grave is popular. For those desiring an improved campground I suggest camping at nearby Natural Bridges National Monument. The Soldier's Grave: In 1884 several cowboys got into a dispute with some Paiute Indians concerning the ownership of a horse. The cowboys called in the U.S. Cavalry to help them with the dispute. A chase ensued during which the Paiutes ambushed the soldiers and killed two of them. The Soldiers are buried at the marked grave just off highway 95. The Paiutes were never captured. Cryptobiotic Soil: This route crosses large areas of cryptobiotic soil. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth. Route Information: From the trailhead (N37° 42' 58\", W110° 03' 36\"), hike north on Cheesebox road for 1/3 mile or about 7 minutes, from this point (N37° 43' 13\", W110° 03' 25\") hike northwest into the pinion and juniper forest. Several minutes after leaving the Cheesebox road you will encounter a deep side canyon (N37° 43' 20\", W110° 03' 37\"). Route find your way to the bottom of the canyon and head downstream. There are several obstacles in this side canyon which can be skirted to the sides as required. Approximately one hour after leaving the trailhead the side canyon you have been following will intersect with the North Fork of Gravel Canyon (N37° 43' 11\", W110° 04' 43\"). Just keep heading downstream. The North Fork of Gravel Canyon is where the real beauty and fun begins. The canyon starts to narrow up and large boulders in the canyon bottom create a fun and interesting obstacle course. You might also begin to encounter some sections of wading. The first real obstacle is a 30-foot rappel into a pool of water, which requires a floating disconnect. The anchor for this rappel is a pinch stone located on the left side (LDC) of the canyon underneath a large chokestone. This is a very scenic section of canyon and the start of the rappel is like jumping out of a cave. The second and last major obstacle is a 35-foot rappel into a pool of water, which requires a floating disconnect. The anchor for this rappel is a horn with a sling located on the right side (LDC) of the canyon. For the remainder of the canyon look high on the right side (LDC) and you will see some fantastic cliff dwellings. Continue downstream through the narrows, swimming, wading and downclimbing as required. The finish of the canyon is through a tight section of narrows which opens into a large glen with about 10 large trees (N37° 42' 12\", W110° 06' 37\"). The hike back to your car will require approximately two hours from the glen. To exit the canyon climb east to the top of the first bench of narrows that you just exited. Don't climb high, just walk along the top of the narrows and enjoy the view into the slot for 1/3 of a mile or about 7 minutes. Stop when you have a really good view of the cliff dwellings on the opposite side of the canyon, this is your exit point (N37° 42' 21\", W110° 06' 23\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/gravel.htm 1/25/2018 Gravel Canyon - Cedar Mesa - Technical Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 Look at the canyon rim opposite of the cliff dwellings and you will see a large rock nose with a prominent black stripe on the east side canyon rim (N37° 42' 26\", W110° 06' 16\"), this is the top of your exit. Route find your way to the base of the nose and exit up the far side (north side) of the nose. This is an easy scrambling exit with little exposure. From here it is a long easy hike back to your car. Hike northeast, keeping Gravel canyon on your left and Found Mesa on your right until you reach the end of Found Mesa and the Cheesebox road. Cliff Dwellings: If you wish to visit the Anasazi cliff dwellings please use proper etiquette. These are some of the better ruins in Cedar Mesa. Reaching the actual ruins requires moderate rock climbing skills. From the exit glen in Gravel Canyon you must climb to the second bench above the narrows on the west canyon wall where you will discover a nice cliff dwelling and a large panel of petroglyphs (N37° 42' 15\", W110° 06' 37\") that cannot be seen from the canyon floor. To visit the cliff dwellings (N37° 42' 30\", W110° 06' 21\"), you spied earlier from the canyon floor you must contour the second bench for 1/2 mile up canyon. If you visit the cliff dwellings take a moment and note your exit route. This will make exiting Gravel Canyon much easier. A visit to the ruins from the glen will require one hour round trip.

The route has a little of everything, including a nice arch and a fantastic petroglyph panel. General Information: Short Canyon is best described as short and amusing. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 2 hours. Short Canyon is rated 3B I using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has the potential to hold a large amount of water, during normal conditions you will likely encounter some wading and at least one swim. Because the canyon is short, wetsuits are not required in warm weather. While Short Canyon does not contain any rappels it is still a technical canyon. A 60-foot rope is useful for handlines, lowering packs and emergency use. A GPS is helpful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Mancos Mesa NE\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Short Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This route has a minor flashflood danger. A quick look to the sky before entering this canyon should be sufficient. Trailhead Information: The actual trailhead is only 1.6 miles off the paved highway. It is simple to walk in if you don't have a high clearance vehicle. Those with a high clearance vehicle can drive right to the trailhead. A vehicle shuttle is not required for this route. Occasionally the road is suitable for two- wheel drives during normal conditions, depending on when it was last graded. From Blanding, Utah: Travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel 60 miles west on Utah Highway 95 to mile marker 60.9. This is known as \"Ducket Crossing\". From Hanksville, Utah: Travel south on Utah Highway 95 for 61 miles to mile marker 60.9. This is known as \"Ducket Crossing\". Ducket Crossing Road: Is officially designated San Juan County Road 2101. Exit Highway 95 on the west side and drive under the highway through the culvert. Follow the road east for 0.6 miles to a fork, take the east (right) fork. Drive an additional 1.0 miles and find a place to park. This is the Short Canyon Trailhead. Route Information: From the Short Canyon Trailhead (N37° 44' 34\", W110° 15' 24\"), rim walk northeast for a brief distance to the head of Short Canyon (N37° 44' 38\", W110° 15' 14\"). A 10-foot drop puts you into the canyon, head downstream and let the fun begin. Soon a 15-foot drop puts you into the slot. Next up is a little stemming over water in normal conditions. The last drop is 20-feet into a pothole. You exit the slot by swimming across a large pool of water. After the swim across the pool of water, head down canyon a small distance and locate the exit (N37° 44' 23\", W110° 15' 28\"), on the west (right) side of the canyon. The exit is a steep slickrock escape back to the rim. But before exiting hike downstream approximately 100-yards http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/short.htm 1/25/2018 Short Canyon - Cedar Mesa - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 and locate an excellent petroglyph panel (N37° 44' 19\", W110° 15' 30\") on the west (right) canyon wall. After viewing the petroglyph panel hike back to the exit and escape the canyon before hiking back to the trailhead. Arch Information: For the arch hunters in the crowd, a nice little arch (N37° 44' 22\", W110° 16' 15\") can be found nearby in White Canyon. You can actually see the arch from Highway 95 if you are looking for it. You can also hike up the bottom of White Canyon from Ducket Crossing if you prefer. Hiker Information: Hikers could easily start at Ducket Crossing, hike up White Canyon and visit the arch and the petroglyph panel for an enjoyable excursion. This hike would require about 2 hours for a round trip.

The site is reached by a short and easy hike. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. Photograph's used on this page are compliments of Bob Maynard. General Information: The Big Crane Petroglyph requires a short hike. A round trip to visit and explore the rock art panel will require approximately 1 1/2 hours. The route is 3/4 mile each way with 80-feet of elevation gain. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. This route can be extremely hot during the middle of the day. The rock art is accessible year round in good weather. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The area is criss crossed with confusing roads and trails. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Bluff SW\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The Big Crane Petroglyph is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Complete information on locating this route is available in the Butler Wash Road Trailhead Guide. Route Information: From the Big Crane Trailhead (N37° 17' 27\", W109° 38' 05\") hike west and cross Butler Wash, do not follow the footprints that descend Butler Wash, if you descend Butler Wash you will encounter a spring after a short distance and know your navigational skills need lots of improvement. Once across Butler Wash stop and take note of Comb Ridge directly in front of you. You will note a canyon to the west-southwest, this is the canyon you want to aim for, do not get sucked into the canyon directly north of your intended destination. As you approach the \"big hump\", stay on the south (left) side of it. Hike up the canyon 3/4 mile (approximately 20 minutes) to the Big Crane Petroglyph (N37° 17' 29\", W109° 38' 47\"). The pictograph is on the north canyon wall and is south facing. The Petroglyph is located about 15-feet high on the canyon wall. Cryptobiotic Soil: This route crosses areas of cryptobiotic crust. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface.

Trailhead Information: The Government Trail Trailhead is accessible to all high clearance vehicles in good weather. Passenger cars can easily access to within approximately 1/2 mile of the actual trailhead. Primitive camping is available along the final 1 1/2 miles of road before the trailhead. From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 28 miles on Utah Highway 95 to the junction of Utah Highway 95 and Utah Highway 261. Travel south on Utah Highway 261 for approximately 13 miles to mile marker 19.1 and a well maintained, unsigned, dirt road heading west (N37° 23' 47\", W109° 56' 38\"). This unsigned dirt road is opposite the signed Cigarette Springs Road which heads east. Turn west (right) onto the unsigned dirt road and follow it for 2.4 miles to a fork signed \"Government Trail\" (N37° 24' 26\", W109° 58' 52\"). Turn west (right) and follow the road for 2.8 miles to an unsigned fork (N37° 24' 14\", W110° 01' 56\"). Turn west (right) and follow the road for 1.8 miles to a signed fork (N37° 24' 13\", W110° 03' 58\"). Turn north (right) and follow the road for 1.4 miles to a stock pond and the signed Government Trail Trailhead. The trailhead contains an information kiosk and a BLM trail register. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bigman.htm 1/25/2018 Big Man Pictograph - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 Route Information: From the Government Trail Trailhead (N37° 24' 58\", W110° 05' 06\"), cross the dam creating the stock pond and follow the trail (actually a closed four wheel drive road) northwest for 2 1/2 miles to the rim of Grand Gulch. The top of the Government Trail (N37° 26' 25\", W110° 06' 37\") where it begins its descent into Grand Gulch is signed \"Government Trail - Grand Gulch Primitive Area\". From the trail sign if you look directly west at Pollys Island you will see several well preserve Anasazi ruins located just under the cap rock. Follow the trail 1/2 mile, as it quickly loses 300-feet of elevation, to the bottom of Grand Gulch (N37° 26' 25\", W110° 06' 53\"). It might be valuable to know that the trail is not shown correctly on the USGS 7.5' maps. The bottom of the actual trail is located approximately 1/4 mile downstream from where the USGS map shows. Once in the bottom of Grand Gulch begin hiking up canyon and enjoy the scenery. After 1 1/4 miles you will pass a well preserved and easy to locate granary (N37° 27' 02\", W110° 06' 29\"). The granary is located on the west (left) canyon wall and is visible from the watercourse if you are looking for it. Continue hiking upstream approximately 1/4 mile past the granary and keep a careful watch for a steep, slickrock, hiker trail heading east (right), up out of the canyon bottom. This is the best trail leading to Big Man Pictograph Panel. If you are lucky the trail might be cairned at the watercourse and along its length. There are actually several use trails that lead up to the pictograph panel, some are much better than others. All the use trails lead up to a bench that runs along the bottom of the cliffs. The Big Man Pictograph Panel (N37° 27' 17\", W110° 06' 25\") is located on the north side of a prominent nose at the base of the shady cliff. Enjoy your visit and return the way you came. A Couple Noteworthy Items: First thing you notice on your visit is that some dumbass has chalked many of the faded images to make them easier to photograph. This is illegal and tainted our visit. We prefer to enjoy rock art in its natural condition without any gringo enhancements. The second item of note is that many believe the large image just to the east (left) of the two painted images is that of a pregnant woman because it depicts a figure in the belly of a larger figure. Pollys Canyon Loop: A visit to the Big Man Pictograph Panel can be combined with a loop hike that exits out Pollys Canyon. This exit is difficult and not for beginners. There is no trails and the route involves some bushwhacking and route finding. The addition of the Pollys Canyon exit to your route will add approximately 2 hours to your adventure.

This route offers a magical experience around almost every bend in the canyon. General Information: Fishmouth Cave Ruins require a short hike. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. A round trip to visit and explore the ruins will require approximately 2 hours. The route is 1 mile each way with minor elevation gain. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The area is criss crossed with confusing roads and trails. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Bluff NW\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Fishmouth Cave is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Fishmouth Cave Ruin contains two alcove ruins, a small cave ruin and the massive Fishmouth Cave itself. Trailhead Information: Complete information on locating this route is available in the Butler Wash Road Trailhead Guide. Route Information: From the Fishmouth Cave Trailhead (N37° 25' 39\", W109° 37' 58\") hike west and cross Butler Wash. Follow one of several braided hiker trails that enter the canyon cutting into Comb Ridge. Follow the canyon west for 1/2 mile to the First Alcove Ruin (N37° 25' 41\", W109° 38' 23\") located on the north (right) side of the canyon. The Second Alcove Ruin (N37° 25' 41\", W109° 38' 27\") is located approximately 100 yards upstream from the first. The ruin is located on the north (right) side of the canyon. Continue upstream for 1/4 mile to reach the Small Cave Ruin (N37° 25' 38\", W109° 38' 38\"). This ruin is located inside a small, easy to identify, cave high on the the north (right) side of the canyon. This ruin contains a BLM register with information on Fishmouth Cave. Use caution as you enter the small cave and walk around as there are numerous pictographs and petroglyphs on the floor of the cave. It is best to avoid the rock art. From the entrance to the Small Cave the massive orifice of Fishmouth Cave (N37° 25' 34\", W109° 38' 42\") is yawning to the west. You will have no trouble locating this massive alcove. The hike up to the cave is short and steep. It is easiest and better for erosion if you follow one of the already present hiker make trails up to the cave. Exploring inside the gigantic alcove will reveal hundreds of hidden treasures. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/fishmouth.htm 1/25/2018 Fishmouth Cave Ruins - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Shane Burrows http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/fishmouth.htm 1/25/2018 Procession Petroglyph Panel - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 1 of 1 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Procession Panel Petroglyphs Cedar Mesa Hiking The Procession Panels main attraction is a 20-foot conga line of tiny marching figures. There are reported to be 179 figures in the line but I never took the time to count them. General Information: The Procession Panel Petroglyphs require a nice little hike. A round trip to visit and explore the rock art panel will require approximately 3 hours. The route is 1 1/4 miles each way with 500-feet of elevation gain. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. This route can be extremely hot during the middle of the day. The rock art is accessible year round in good weather. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The area is criss crossed with confusing roads and trails. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Bluff SW\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The Procession Panel is rated 1A II using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Complete information on locating this route is available in the Butler Wash Road Trailhead Guide. Route Information: From the Procession Panel Trailhead (N37° 21' 03\", W109° 37' 44\") hike west and cross Butler Wash. Once across Butler Wash stop and take note of Comb Ridge directly in front of you. You will note a canyon with a red ridge guarding its south side. This is the canyon you want to aim for, do not get sucked into the canyon directly north of the canyon with a red ridge. Hike southeast to the low angle slickrock slope and hike west up the slope. If your route finding is good you should pass to the south side of a large dryfall. From the top of the dryfall continue hiking up canyon for about 1/3 mile until a massive red and black cliff is visible on your north (right) side. This cliff is filled with petroglyphs along its base. The Procession Panel (N37° 21' 02\", W109° 38' 55\") is near the top or west end of the cliff. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

I know of very few rock art sites that yield such a big bang for so little effort. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Walnut Knob is a short 1/4 mile hike with a 250 foot elevation gain. A round trip to visit and explore the rock art will require approximately 1 hour. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. Walnut Knob is accessible year round in good weather. A trip to Walnut Knob is often combined with a visit to the Arch Canyon Ruins and Beaver Pond Ruins. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Hotel Rock\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Walnut Knob is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 14 miles on Utah Highway 95 to mile marker 107. At mile marker 107 (N37° 30' 41\", W109° 39' 23\") turn north (right) on the graded Comb Wash Road (SJC 205) and follow it for 2.3 miles to a junction. At this junction the Dog Tanks Road heads south (left) and the Comb Wash Road continues north (right). This junction is the trailhead for Walnut Knob. The trailhead is easy to identify because Walnut Knob should be easily visible immediately to the west. This trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in dry weather conditions. Route Information: From the Walnut Knob Trailhead (N37° 32' 34\", W109° 39' 58\") you should easily be able to view the large rock outcropping 1/4 mile to your west. This large rock outcropping is Walnut Knob (N37° 32' 35\", W109° 40' 12\"). Hike the 1/4 mile west to Walnut Knob and explore around the base of the cliffs to find several excellent panels of rock art.

The ruin is impressive. Kivas were the center of Anasazi ceremonial and social life. General Information: Seven Kivas is a very interesting ruin located in the bottom of Road Canyon. A round trip to visit and explore the ruins will require approximately 3 or 4 hours. The route is 1 1/2 miles each way with just over 500-feet of elevation change. The route does require some minor scrambling. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. Those will to do additional exploring will find other nice ruins in the area. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Snow Flat Spring Cave\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Seven Kivas is rated 2A II using the Canyon Rating System. A BLM Backcountry Permit is required to hike Seven Kivas.

Kiva Information: Kivas are small, round rooms dug into the ground and were an important part of the Anasazi lifestyle. They were used for ceremonies and socializing. Kivas functioned like a church as well as a living room. And because Kivas were built underground, their roofs served a purpose too. Anasazi men and women gathered on the roof of the kiva to weave and grind corn and Anasazi children often played there. The roof of the kiva was the Anasazi's courtyard.

From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 14 miles on Utah Highway 95 to mile marker 107. At mile marker 107 (N37° 30' 41\", W109° 39' 23\") turn north (right) on the graded Comb Wash Road (SJC 205) and follow it for 2.3 miles to a junction (N37° 32' 34\", W109° 39' 58\"). At this junction the Dog Tanks Road heads south (left) and the Comb Wash Road continues north (right). This junction is also the trailhead for the popular Walnut Knob Petroglyph Panel. Turn north (right) and follow the Comb Wash Road for 0.1 miles to a junction (N37° 32' 40\", W109° 39' 55\"). At this junction the Arch Canyon Road heads west (left) and the Comb Wash Road continues north (straight ahead). Those with passenger vehicles will want to park here and walk the remain distance. Those with high clearance or 4x4 vehicles can continue on and drive to the actual trailhead. Turn west (left) and follow the Arch Canyon Road 0.4 miles to the signed Arch Canyon Ruins. The ruins are located under the cliff on the north side of Arch Canyon. The Arch Canyon Ruins are the trailhead for the Beaver Pond Ruins. Route Information: From the Beaver Pond Ruins Trailhead and Arch Canyon Ruins (N37° 32' 48\", W109° 40' 18\") follow Arch Canyon west for 400-yards. You will round a corner in Arch Canyon and encounter thick willows and a beaver pond. There are two good ways around the beaver pond. You can cut through the willows on the downstream side and cross over the top of the beaver dam, or you can follow the 4x4 road to the upstream side of the beaver pond and walk around the pond. The first option is shorter, the second option is easier. Pick your poison. Those with a serious 4x4 can actually drive to the upstream side of the beaver pond, but it is usually more trouble than it's worth. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/beaverpond.htm 1/25/2018 Beaver Pond Anasazi Ruins - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 The first set of Beaver Pond Ruins (N37° 32' 51\", W109° 40' 23\") are located on a ledge directly above the beaver dam, on the north wall of Arch Canyon. The second set of Beaver Pond Ruins (N37° 32' 55\", W109° 40' 27\") are located 400-yards northwest of the first set of ruins. The second set of ruins are difficult to see until you reach them, as they are hidden in a alcove on the north wall of Arch Canyon. There is a faint hiker trail leading from the first set of ruins to the second set. You will find many petroglyphs and pictographs on the cliff walls behind the ruins if you look closely. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

Among the numerous Anasazi ruins to be found in the canyon are the famous Jail House Ruin and Perfect Kiva Ruin. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Bullet Canyon contains many outstanding ruins for day hikers to explore, and provides excellent access into and out of Grand Gulch for those doing multi day backpack trips. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. Spring and fall are the ideal times for this hike. The canyon is very hot in summer and cold in the winter. The time required to hike from the Bullet Canyon Trailhead to Grand Gulch is approximately 4 hours each way. Day hikers wanting to visit Perfect Kiva and Jail House Ruin will require approximately 3 hours each way, add in time to explore the ruins and you have a full day. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least two liters of water. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route and in locating specific ruins. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Pollys Pasture\" and \"Cedar Mesa North\" show the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. Bullet Canyon contains a use trail for it's entire length, the trail is never very difficult to follow if you pay attention. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Bullet Canyon is rated 1A III using the Canyon Rating System. A BLM Backcountry Permit is required to hike Bullet Canyon. The closest permit station is a self serve station located at the Bullet Canyon Trailhead. Trailhead Information: The Bullet Canyon Trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in good weather. Camping is available at the trailhead and other nearby locations. From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 28 miles on Utah Highway 95 to the junction of Utah Highway 95 and Utah Highway 261. Travel south on Utah Highway 261 for approximately 10 1/2 miles to mile marker 21.7 and the signed Bullet Canyon Road (N37° 25' 51\", W109° 56' 00\"). Turn west (right) onto the Bullet Canyon Road (SJC 251). Follow the well maintained dirt road for 1.1 miles to the signed Bullet Canyon Trailhead. There is a trail register, self-serve permit station, and parking for several vehicles at the trailhead. Route Information: From the Bullet Canyon Trailhead (N37° 25' 50\", W109° 57' 01\"), follow the trail west for a short distance to where it descends to the bottom of Bullet Canyon. You will find numerous ruins in this canyon, all are located on the north (right) side so keep a sharp lookout. All the ruins I know of are correctly noted on the map, these ruins range from a few scattered remnants to outstandingly well preserved archeological finds that will astonish you. Shortly after dropping into Bullet Canyon you will see the tower of Rim Ruin guarding the canyons entrance. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bullet.htm 1/25/2018 Bullet Canyon - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 Once in the bottom of Bullet Canyon it's almost impossible to get lost, just follow the canyon downstream. Where the trail crosses slickrock watch for cairns (small piles of stacked rocks) to help guide you. At several minor obstacles the trail will follow a ledge on the north (right) side of the canyon. Noting this trail will eliminate some boulder hoping. 4 1/2 miles after leaving the trailhead you will find Perfect Kiva (N37° 26' 13\", W110° 00' 33\") hidden in a large alcove of a north side tributary. This ruin receives it's name from the well preserved kiva that was originally found at this site. The kiva had it's original roof intact when discovered. The roof has since been replaced because of hiker damage. The kiva contains a wooden ladder leading down into its interior. There are no restrictions against entering the kiva, but please use caution to avoid damage. Approximately 1/4 mile downstream from Perfect Kiva is Jail House Ruin (N37° 26' 16\", W110° 00' 46\"). This ruin is fairly easy to locate as there are three large white circles painted on the cliff above the ruins. The circles are easy to see from most of the canyon. The easiest way to reach Jail House from Perfect Kiva is to just walk the bench that Perfect Kiva is located on and you will soon run into several trails leading to Jail House Ruin. This ruin receives its name from a window in the center of the ruin that appears to contain jail bars. Located in the canyon bottom just below Jail House Ruin is a water source known as Jail House Spring (N37° 26' 11\", W110° 00' 53\"). There are several backpacker established campsites in this area. It's a 2 mile hike down canyon from Jail House Spring to the junction with Grand Gulch. Bullet Spring (N37° 26' 43\", W110° 02' 32\") is located at the junction and is a water source. There are several backpacker established campsites in this area. Bullet Canyon - Sheiks Canyon Loop: Bullet Canyon combines well with Sheiks Canyon to create an outstanding loop hike. If completing this route as a loop I strongly recommend descending Sheiks Canyon and exiting out Bullet Canyon. The climb up and out of Sheiks is more difficult than climbing up and out of Bullet Canyon. A vehicle shuttle is the best option for completing this loop, a mountain bike shuttle also works extremely well as the trailheads are only 3 miles apart on well maintained dirt roads. As a last resort you can walk the road between trailheads. The best route is to hike down Sheiks Canyon to Grand Gulch, Hike 1 1/2 miles down Grand Gulch to Bullet Canyon, Hike up Bullet Canyon. This loop will require approximately 8 to 9 hours to complete. Kane Gulch to Bullet Canyon: Bullet Canyon can be done as part of a longer backpacking trip known as Kane Gulch to Bullet Canyon.

This is a no bullshit place equivalent to a medieval European castle. The Citadel is an ancient fortress designed to wage war. The approach is a tight and heavily defended walkway, which is guarded by a precipice to each side. No uninvited guest is about to storm this stronghold. General Information: The Citadel is a very interesting ruin that sits on a narrow peninsula that juts out into Road Canyon. A round trip to visit and explore the ruins will require approximately 3 or 4 hours. The route is 1 3/4 miles each way with minor elevation gain. The route does require some minor scrambling and walking along the edge of a lofty cliff. Those afraid of heights might look elsewhere for some fun. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The area is criss crossed with confusing roads and trails. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Snow Flat Spring Cave\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The Citadel is rated 2A II using the Canyon Rating System. A BLM Backcountry Permit is required to hike The Citadel. The closest permit station is a self serve located 1 mile from Utah Highway 261 on the Cigarette Springs Road (SJC 239). You will drive right next to this station on your way to the trailhead. Trailhead Information: A high clearance vehicle is advised for accessing this trailhead, four-wheel-drive is not required. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. The trailhead contains parking for several vehicles. Camping is available at the trailhead and other nearby locations. A carefully driven passenger car can usually access to within one mile of the actual trailhead in good weather. From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 28 miles on Utah Highway 95 to the junction of Utah Highway 95 and Utah Highway 261. Travel south on Utah Highway 261 for approximately 13 miles to mile mark 19.1 and the signed Cigarette Springs Road (N37° 23' 47\", W109° 56' 38\"). Reset your mileage here and turn east (left) onto the Cigarette Springs Road (SJC 239). Follow the well maintained dirt road for 5.9 miles to a track heading north (N37° 22' 55\", W109° 50' 38\"). Follow the track heading north for 0.8 miles to the end of the road. This is The Citadel Trailhead. There is parking for several vehicles at the trailhead. This is also the trailhead for the popular Seven Kivas. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/citadel.htm 1/25/2018 Citadel Ruins - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 Route Information: From the Citadel Trailhead (N37° 23' 28\", W109° 50' 09\") hike east along the edge of Road Canyon. There are several trails that generally head east, follow the most well traveled route to minimize impact. After hiking approximately 1 1/2 miles you will realize that you are on a peninsula. If you have chosen wisely and followed the most well traveled route you will be deposited on the canyon rim at a point where you can easily scramble down from the top of the peninsula. At this point you should have a clear view of The Citadel (N37° 23' 19\", W109° 48' 27\"). The ruins are located under the capstone at the very top of the knob. You will find ruins all the way around the top knob, but the finest are on the south side. I found the best place to scramble down is located approximately 150 yards west of the tip of the peninsula and faces north. You want to drop through the first cliff band down to the top of second cliff band. Once on top of the second cliff band walk around the nose of the peninsula to the south side and descend the slickrock to the top of the walkway. As you begin traversing the walkway you will first encounter a 6-foot ledge. Note as you scramble to the top of this ledge that it is capped with an ancient wall that was once used as a defensive position. As you cross the narrowest constriction of the walkway note the second defensive wall. As you reach The Citadel you will find it easiest to access the ruins by scrambling up the south side using a couple of massive boulders. Cryptobiotic Soil: You will encounter areas of cryptobiotic crust along this route. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires years of undisturbed growth before it becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth.

The ruins contain many interesting structures and varied pictographs and petroglyphs. The more adventurous can scramble over to an outstanding viewpoint of Eagle's Nest, which are amazing Anasazi ruins built high in the alcove of a massive sandstone cliff. General Information: Cold Spring Cave requires a short hike. A round trip to visit and explore the ruins will require approximately 2 1/2 hours. Add an additional hour if you plan to visit Eagle's Nest. The route to Cold Spring Cave is 3/4 miles each way with minor elevation gain. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. Those planning to visit the Eagle's Nest View Point might want to bring along a 30-rope for handlines, raising packs and emergency use. The detour to Eagle's nest involves a short scramble. The scramble is not difficult and should not be a problem for most intermediate and experienced hikers. A pair of binoculars will prove beneficial when viewing the Eagle's Nest. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The area is criss crossed with confusing roads and trails. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Bluff SW\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Cold Spring Cave is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Complete information on locating this route is available in the Butler Wash Road Trailhead Guide. Route Information: From the Cold Spring Cave Trailhead (N37° 21' 51\", W109° 37' 38\") follow the obvious track west for 1/4 mile to Butler Wash. Cross the wash by following the most well used hiker trail that heads towards the obvious canyon cutting into Comb Ridge. Follow the trail as it leads into the canyon cutting deep into Comb Ridge. Approximately 1/2 mile after crossing Butler Wash the canyon forks, take the north (right) fork and follow the trail an additional 150-yards to Cold Spring Cave (N37° 21' 57\", W109° 38' 24\"). The hike is easy with only minor elevation gain. There are several dozens of handprints on the walls above the ruins. There is a small spring in the back of the cave. For those trekking on to visit Eagle's Nest you must continue hiking up the canyon that Cold Spring Cave is in. Just above Cold Spring Cave the canyon boxes up. The escape from this small box canyon are old and worn moki steps on the north wall. The scramble is not difficult and should not be a problem for experienced hikers. There are plenty of hand and foot holds. Once out of the box canyon hike cross country in a northwest direction. After about 1/4 mile you will intersect a deep, steep walled canyon. Eagle's Nest (N37° 22' 08\", W109° 38' 41\") is located high on the north wall and should be easily visible. Hike up the rim of the canyon until you are directly across form Eagle's Nest for the best viewpoint (N37° 22' 03\", W109° 38' 42\"). After http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/coldspring.htm 1/25/2018 Cold Spring Cave - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 viewing Eagle's Nest you can return to Cold Spring Cave or hike east directly down the ridge you are currently standing on. History: Cold Spring Cave and Eagle's Nest were discovered by the 1892 Illustrated America Exploring Expedition. Warren K. Moorehead was appointed as leader of the expedition to explore, survey, map, photograph, and secure specimens in southeastern Utah. Although the Illustrated America Exploring Expedition collection of artifacts was very small, Moorehead and members of his expedition wrote enthusiastically and romantically about their adventures and discoveries in a series of articles for American Illustrated Magazine. Their descriptions of alcoves and ruins in Butler Wash are memorable. Discovery of Cold Spring Cave: Here is what the 1892 Illustrated America Exploring Expedition wrote about the discovery of Cold Spring Cave. \"In the immense sandstone spur outcropping between Butler's Wash and Comb Wash, about ten miles north of the San Juan River, we noticed a large cave in one of the deep canyons in the ledge, and, examining it with our field glasses we thought we could distinguish ruins near the opening. Four of us started to investigate and found it a cavern of great dimensions, with the whole floor under the overhanging ledge studded with ruins. The canyon in which this picturesque cave town is situated is wild and beautiful, shut in on all sides by high sandstone cliffs, and having only one narrow entrance. The foliage is almost tropical in its luxuriousness. We found cactus plants of gigantic size, and grass and flowering plants over a foot in height, while the bare rocky ledges were studded with cedars, cottonwood and pinions. This luxurious growth of cactus and of other plants which were stunted upon mesas is probably caused by the heat being retained in the bare, rocky ledges, thus producing the forcing effect of a green house. We have named the place Cold Spring Cave, on account of the fine spring of cold, clear water away in the back interior of the cave. it flows out from under the heavy sandstone ledge into a round, clear pool, and, after passing through a short outlet, sinks into the ground and disappears, not half a dozen feet from where it started.\" Discovery of Eagle's Nest: Here is what the 1892 Illustrated America Exploring Expedition wrote about the discovery of Eagle's Nest. \"While examining the canyons near Cold Spring Cave, our attention was attracted to a cave-like recess near the top of one of he high cliffs, about a mile to the northwest. We gave it the fitting name of Eagle’s Nest. As it looked difficult of access, we took a long stout rope and started up the cliff, intending, if possible, to obtain entrance to it by means of the rope from the top of the cliff. Upon reaching the top, the cliff proved very much higher than we had expected. Beneath us was full four hundred feet of sheer precipice, the cave being situated about fifty feet from the top. We fastened our rope to three sage-brushes, about fifty feet apart, and then, by clinging to the rope and swinging from one foothold to another, we were able to reach the floor of the cave, although at first it seemed a difficult feat to swing under the overhanging ledge into the cave.\" \"One can not see the bottom of the cliff from the cave, yet if a rock is hurled over the side, it can be heard crashing its way down the sides of the cliff to a surprisingly great depth.\" [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/coldspring.htm 1/25/2018 Doll House Anasazi Ruin - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Doll House Anasazi Ruin Cedar Mesa Hiking Doll House is a beautiful and well preserved Anasazi (sometimes called Ancient Pueblo or Ancestral Pueblo) cliff dwelling tucked into a secluded alcove.

Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Hobbs Wash is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. History: Hobbs Wash - As a winter storm approached, four nearly starved scouts, George Hobbs, George Morrill, Lemuel Redd Sr. and George Sevey, sought shelter for the night in this area on December 27, 1879. The scouts were exploring for a feasible route for the 250 Mormon (Hole- in-the-Rock) pioneers to follow from their encampment above the Colorado River Gorge 100 miles west of here. George Hobbs: \"Night overtook us, we camped in this small canyon, this being our third day without food. I cut my name in the rock with the date I was there, not knowing that I would survive the journey\" Trailhead Information: From Bluff, Utah drive west on Highway 191 approximately 4 miles to the junction with Highway 163.

Hike southwest along the rim of Butler Wash for 100 yards to where a very minor drainage joins Butler Wash and offers an easy route down through the cliff bands to a ledge about 30 feet above the bottom of Butler Wash. Once on the ledge you will notice a minor hiker trail. Follow the trail northeast along the ledge for approximately 100 yards and you will walk directly into the Hobbs Wash Ruins (N37° 15' 30\", W109° 39' 27\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/hobbswash.htm 1/25/2018 Hobbs Wash Ruins - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Shane Burrows http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/hobbswash.htm 1/25/2018 Lewis Lodge - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Lewis Lodge Anasazi Ruins Cedar Mesa Hiking Lewis Lodge is an amazing collection of ruins that create a fortress perched on the edge of an 800-foot high cliff. The view of the ruins is incredible, the views from the ruins are even better. General Information: Lewis Lodge is one of the best Anasazi ruins in Cedar Mesa. The drive to Lewis Lodge reaches elevations of 7900 feet with the trailhead located at 6700 feet. The high elevation of these ruins means winter conditions and weather can be a major issue, depending on the time of year. The ruins themselves are located at the head of a tributary of Arch Canyon. The ruins are accessible during the summer and fall months. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. A round trip to visit and explore the ruins will require approximately 4 hours from the trailhead. Plan to spend a full day visiting Lewis Lodge after you factor in the backcountry driving required to reach the trailhead. The actual hiking route is 1 1/2 miles each way with less than 300 feet of elevation change. The route does require some minor scrambling. This ruin is located high on a cliff and is not recommended for young children. Older supervised children who understand the dangers should be able to visit these ruins. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Hotel Rock\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Lewis Lodge is rated 2A II using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: A High Clearance vehicle can easily access to within 2 miles of the Lewis Lodge Trailhead, which combined with a little road walking makes these ruins accessible without to much effort. A four wheel drive vehicle is required to reach the actual trailhead. A stock four wheel drive truck or SUV should have no problem reaching the Lewis Lodge Trailhead in good weather conditions. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. The trailhead contains plenty of parking. Camping is available near the trailhead and other nearby locations. From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 6 miles on Utah Highway 95 to mile marker 115 and the signed South Cottonwood Canyon Road (N37° 33' 46\", W109° 35' 01\"). Turn north (right) onto the South Cottonwood Canyon Road (SJC 228). Follow the well maintained dirt road for 7.9 miles to a Y-junction (N37° 38' 59\", W109° 37' 36\"). Take the south (left) fork (SJC 228) and drive an additional 9.3 miles to a spur road heading south (left) with a small sign that reads \"Milk Ranch Point\" (N37° 40' 28\", W109° 45' 34\"). Follow the spur road south for 5.3 miles to the Lewis Lodge Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify as a fence crosses the road and there is a corral on the east side of the road. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/lewis.htm 1/25/2018 Lewis Lodge - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 Route Information: From the Lewis Lodge Trailhead (N37° 36' 45\", W109° 43' 58\"), hike west, following the fence line. There is no established trail but you should be able to follow several braided social trails. After hiking about 1/2 mile west you will encounter the head of the canyon that Lewis Lodge is located in. You must loop north, around the head of the canyon, and follow the rim south to a sandstone nose (N37° 36' 45\", W109° 44' 25\"). The sandstone nose allows you to climb down to the next level. From the base of the sandstone nose you must continue to follow the rim of the canyon south to a sandstone ramp/crack system (N37° 36' 34\", W109° 44' 37\"). From the top of the ramp/crack system you should have some outstanding views of Lewis Lodge just under the east rim of the canyon (N37° 36' 28\", W109° 44' 29\"). Descending the ramp/crack system is the crux of the route. There is some minor exposure, but the scramble down the ramp/crack is not difficult if you take your time. The ramp is always sidewalk wide and contains plenty of good hand holds. From the base of the ramp/crack you must hike back around the head of the canyon just under the rim. You will begin to encounter ruins almost immediately as you walk the ledge at the base of the ramp/crack system. At the head of the canyon you will find a seep that provides water. Just past the seep you will discover at least two defensive walls that would have made Lewis Lodge an impregnable fortress during its day. The best ruins and a well preserved kiva are past the defensive walls. Kiva Information: Lewis Lodge contain a remarkable kiva that is extremely well preserved. Kivas are small, round rooms dug into the ground and were an important part of the Anasazi lifestyle. They were used for ceremonies and socializing. Kivas functioned like a church as well as a living room. And because Kivas were built underground, their roofs served a purpose too. Anasazi men and women gathered on the roof of the kiva to weave and grind corn and Anasazi children often played there. The roof of the kiva was the Anasazi's courtyard.

These ruins are almost effortless to reach and require only a short stroll. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Lower Mule Canyon requires a short hike. A round trip to visit and explore the ruins will require approximately 2 hours. The route is 1/2 mile each way with minor elevation gain.

All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Lower Mule Canyon is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Ancient Pueblo vs. Ancestral Pueblo vs. Anasazi: The word \"Anasazi\" has popularly come to mean 'ancient ones' but is considered by some to be a racist term. The word itself is Navajo, meaning \"enemy ancestors.\" It is unfortunate that a non-Pueblo word has come to stand for a tradition that is certainly ancestral Pueblo. The term was first applied to the ruins of Mesa Verde by Richard Wetherill, a rancher and trader who, in 1888-1889, was the first Anglo-American to explore the sites in that area. Wetherill knew and worked with Navajos and understood what the word meant. The name was further sanctioned in archaeology when it was adopted by Alfred V. Kidder, the acknowledged dean of Southwestern Archaeology. Kidder felt that is was less cumbersome than a more technical term he might have used. Using the term Ancient Pueblo or Ancestral Pueblo is also problematical. Such usage obscures the observation that the Mogollon tradition is also considered to be ancestral to Pueblo peoples. Most archaeologists are tradition bound and continue to use the term Anasazi, which is prominent in their professional literature. Additionally, some archaeologists who would try to change the term have worried that because the Pueblos speak different languages, there are different words for \"ancestor,\" and using one might be offensive to people speaking other languages.

A metate and mano were used to grind corn and beans into a powder or flour which could then be combined with water, molded into various shapes and cooked. A metate is the large stone on which the grain is placed. A mano is a smaller stone tool (or rock) used to grind the corn or other grains. Trailhead Information: Complete information on locating this route is available in the Butler Wash Road Trailhead Guide. Route Information: From the Monarch Cave Trailhead (N37° 21' 31\", W109° 37' 51\") hike west and cross Butler Wash. Follow one of several braided hiker trails that enter the canyon cutting into Comb Ridge. Follow the canyon west for 3/4 miles to Monarch Cave (N37° 21' 30\", W109° 38' 34\"). The hike is easy with only minor elevation gain. As you step through the main entrance of the ruins look on the north wall and you should see an inscription that reads \"Monarch's Cave 1892\" inscribed in the wall. This was placed by the Illustrated America Exploring Expedition of 1892. A small amount of searching along this same wall will also reveal several pictographs and petroglyphs. The rock art is scattered for 100 yards down canyon along the cliff wall from the ruins. History: The Monarch Cave Ruins contain an inscription from the Illustrated America Exploring Expedition of 1892. Warren K. Moorehead was appointed as leader of the Illustrated America Exploring Expedition to explore, survey, map, photograph, and secure specimens in southeastern Utah. Although the Illustrated America Exploring Expedition collection of artifacts was very small, Moorehead and members of his expedition wrote enthusiastically and romantically about their adventures and discoveries in a series of articles for American Illustrated Magazine. Their descriptions of alcoves and ruins in Butler Wash are memorable. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/monarch.htm 1/25/2018 Monarch Cave Ruins - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 Below is a sketch made by a member of the 1892 Illustrated America Exploring Expedition of Monarch Cave Ruins. It's interesting to note the ruins appear to remain in about the same conditions as when they were first discovered. Discovery: Here is what the 1892 Illustrated America Exploring Expedition wrote about the discovery of Monarch Cave. After Mr. Moorehead left us, in one of the deep canyons, about two miles south of Eagle Nest Cave, we discovered one of the most picturesque series of ruins that we had yet seen. It is situated in a beautiful box canyon in the rocky divide between Butler's Wash and Comb Wash, about nine miles south [Note: South is a direct quote, the correct direction is North.] of the Rio San Juan. The canyon is bout half a mile in length, but what a contrast it affords to the monotonous and bare mesa and valleys outside! here instead of of stunted sage-brush, we find a luxurious growth of large, wide-spreading cottonwood tress, giving delightful shade from the hot sun; and beautiful shrubbery and flowering plants, and cool running water. One can appreciate the great difference only after traveling all day on the dry and sandy mesa, where not a drop of water is to be found, and then entering one of these little side canyons, which seem like paradise on earth. One of the large cottonwood trees measured fifteen feet around the base - a wonderful growth for this locality. Directly to the west end of the canyon, the high sandstone cliff's, with a graceful and undulating curve on their weathered surfaces, close together abruptly, forming a large cavern about one hundred feet from the bottom of the canyon. In this cave are the ruins ruins we are about to describe. From their prominent position they command the valley, and their curved fronts, cut with dozens of loopholes, give the effect of a modern fortress. We named it Monarch's Cave, for it must have been monarch of all it surveyed. The cavern was thirty-five feet in height at the front, and fifty-seven and three-fifths feet deep, forming an excellent stronghold and a perfect shelter. It is only accessible on the north, and then only by using the ancient footholds which have been cut into the slanting sandstone ledge. As many of these have been worn away, it is with no little difficulty that one gains the entrance into the cave. Directly under the mouth, at the bottom of the canyon, and almost hidden by shrubbery, is a large excellent spring of clear, cold water, measuring thirty feet across and having a depth at the center of four feet. Such a source of water was of extraordinary importance to ancient dwellers in the cavern. It not only supplied them with water, but also irrigated the canyon for the cultivation of their crops. At the back of the cave water trickles down the ledge of rock causing a thick growth of hanging ferns and creeping vines, adding much to the beauty of the place. Judging from the large number of loopholes in these ruins, the structure was evidently intended as a fortification. In one room alone we counted twenty-five loopholes. From these the defenders could send their arrows in every direction, up or down the canyon. The front walls of the prominent rooms are all rounded, so that by means of the loopholes the whole canyon below could be commanded. The entire entire aspect of the cave is of defense and protection rather than comfort.

The main ruin has both an inner and outer section, built with two walls providing fortification. The center room in the main structure is decorated in white, with a crescent moon uncolored on one wall, and a full moon uncolored on the opposing wall. It's from these pictographs that the ruin inherits its name. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Moon House is a very well preserved ruin that sits on a ledge midway up the side of McCloyd Canyon. A round trip to visit and explore the ruins will require approximately 3 or 4 hours. The route is less then 1/2 mile but some minor scrambling is required to work you way through several cliff bands. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. You will want to bring a flashlight when you visit the ruin to look inside the rooms. The center room of the main structure contains a crescent moon and a full moon painted on the walls which give the ruin its name. Please do not enter the room but view the paintings using a flashlight. You will not find many surface artifacts like pottery shards at Moon House because of a 1974 surface collection by archaeologists which recovered all small visible artifacts. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The area is criss- crossed with confusing roads and trails. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Snow Flat Spring Cave\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Moon House is rated 2A II using the Canyon Rating System. BLM Permit: A BLM Backcountry Permit is required to hike McCloyd Canyon. The closest permit station is a self serve located 1 mile from Utah Highway 261 on the Snow Flats Road (SJC 237). You will drive right next to this station on your way to the trailhead. You will also need a McCloyd Canyon/Moon House Recreation Management Zone Day Use Permit as noted below. McCloyd Canyon/Moon House Day Use Permit: Public access will be limited to 20 people per day via a permit system for day visits. Entry into Moon House Recreation Management Zone requires a Special Recreation Permit available only at the Kane Gulch Ranger Station during the high use season. Day, Week, and Annual Permit holders must get their permits validated for Moon House hikes at the Kane Gulch Ranger Station prior to their hike. During the off season, permits will be available on a first come first serve basis at the trailhead entry. All commercial and private groups of 8 or more must have an advance reservation, available from the Monticello Field Office permit desk. Maximum group size is 12. There is no overnight camping within the Management Zone, and car camping is limited only to the designated primitive camp and park area south of Snow Flat Road. Pets are not allowed in this management zone. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/moonhouse.htm 1/25/2018 Moon House Ruins - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 3 Trailhead Information: A high clearance vehicle is advised for accessing this trailhead, four-wheel-drive is not required. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. The trailhead contains parking for several vehicles. Camping is available in several locations near the trailhead. From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 28 miles on Utah Highway 95 to the junction of Utah Highway 95 and Utah Highway 261. Travel south on Utah Highway 261 for approximately 10 miles to mile marker 22.5 and the signed Snow Flats Road (N37° 26' 28\", W109° 55' 22\"). Turn east (left) onto the Snow Flats Road (SJC 237). Follow the dirt road for 0.4 miles to a fork. Take the north (left) fork and drive an additional 7.7 miles. At this point you should see an information kiosk (N37° 25' 02\", W109° 47' 59\") on the north (left) side of the road and a parking area for several cars on the south side of the road. In the past the BLM has attempted to close the road at this point and force everyone to hike in. Thanks to San Juan County this road is again open for public use. At the information kiosk turn north (left) and follow the road 1.1 miles north to the Moon House Trailhead. You will know you have reached the trailhead when signs noting \"no vehicles beyond this point\" are encountered. There is parking for several vehicles at the trailhead. Route Information: From the Moon House Trailhead (N37° 25' 57\", W109° 47' 51\") hike northeast along the well defined trail to the rim of McCloyd Canyon. From the canyon rim the route snakes down through the cliff bands to the bottom of the canyon. The trail is extremely well cairned and not difficult to follow through the cliff bands if care is used to assure you are on the right route. About midway down into the canyon you should be able to look across McCloyd Canyon and see Moon House Ruins. Upon reaching the canyon bottom hike downstream 50-yards to the weakness up jumbled rocks that allows scrambling access to Moon House Ruins (N37° 26' 10\", W109° 47' 40\"). By walking 1/2 mile east or west on the same ledge that Moon House is located on you will encounter several additional ruins that are worth visiting. The ruins to the east are particularly note worthy and nearly as good as Moon House but minus the pictographs. Medieval Fortress: Moon House is one of the best Anasazi ruins to be found anywhere. It contains an inner chamber, with a protective curtain wall containing numerous loopholes strategically placed to aim arrows at intruders. Erected in 1262 A.D., the curtain wall shields a hidden courtyard similar to the construction of Medieval European castles built in the same time period. Cryptobiotic Soil: You will encounter areas of cryptobiotic crust along this route. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires years of undisturbed growth before it becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth. Video: Enjoy a short HD video of a trip to Moon House Ruin.

# 414 Over Under Ruins - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Over/Under Anasazi Ruins Cedar Mesa Hiking Over/Under Ruin is a fun little hike to a spectacular viewpoint that the entire family can enjoy. Those with a little more ambition can scramble down and visit the ruins. General Information: Over/Under is a very well preserved ruin hidden in a tributary of North Fork Whiskers Draw. The hike to the viewpoint is suitable for the entire family. The hike involves an easy 1/3 mile approach to a impressive viewpoint. The elevation loss to the viewpoint is only 165-feet. A round trip to the viewpoint is approximately 1 hour. To hike down and visit the ruins will require approximately 2 hours. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The area is criss- crossed with confusing roads and trails. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Cream Pots\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The Over/Under viewpoint is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Any vehicle can access this trailhead in good weather. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Camping is available in several locations near the trailhead. From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 6 miles on Utah Highway 95 to mile marker 115 and the signed South Cottonwood Canyon Road (N37° 33' 46\", W109° 35' 01\"). Turn north (right) onto the South Cottonwood Canyon Road (SJC 228). Follow the well maintained dirt road for 7.9 miles to a Y-junction (N37° 38' 59\", W109° 37' 36\"). Take the south (left) fork (SJC 228) and drive an additional 2.7 miles. You should see a turn- out on the south (left) side of the road that will accommodated several vehicles. This is the Over/Under Trailhead. Route Information: From the Over/Under Trailhead (N37° 39' 05\", W109° 40' 16\") hike south along a good jeep trail. The trail will shortly head out onto slickrock. Just follow the slickrock until it begins to narrow into a ridge above a canyon to your north (left) side. Look into the canyon and you should have an excellent view of the Over/Under Ruins (N37° 38' 48\", W109° 40' 15\"). The trail to this point is extremely easy and suitable for nearly the entire family. For those who actually want to visit the ruins continue hiking down the ridge until you can scramble down to the canyon bottom. Next hike back up canyon to the ruins. The canyon bottom is a bit of a bushwhack. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/overunder.htm 1/25/2018 Over Under Ruins - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/overunder.htm 1/25/2018 Pollys Canyon - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Pollys Canyon Anasazi Ruins Cedar Mesa Hiking Pollys Canyon is an interesting loop hike that visits a tributary of Grand Gulch that does not see a lot of traffic. The route visits one of the better and larger Anasazi Ruins in the Grand Gulch system. The route uses the hiker friendly \"Government Trail\" to access Grand Gulch. The Government Trail is often used by backpackers and hikers to explore ruins and rock art in Grand Gulch. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Pollys Canyon is a nice hike suitable for intermediate and advanced hikers. This is not a route for beginners. The journey uses a route known as the Government Trail that provides excellent access into and out of Grand Gulch for those doing day hikes or multi-day backpack trips. The canyon is accessible year round in good weather. Spring and fall are the ideal times for this hike. This route is very hot in summer and cold in the winter. Binoculars will prove beneficial when viewing some of the ruins along this route. Pollys Canyon is rated 2A III using the Canyon Rating System. The time required for a round trip is approximately 5 hours. This route can be completed in either direction, but will be described clockwise for this route description. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least two liters of water.

The top of the Government Trail (N37° 26' 25\", W110° 06' 37\") where it begins its descent into Grand Gulch is signed \"Government Trail - Grand Gulch Primitive Area\". From the trail sign if you look directly west at Pollys Island you will see several well preserve Anasazi ruins located just under the cap rock. Follow the trail 1/2 mile, as it quickly loses 300-feet of elevation, to the bottom of Grand Gulch (N37° 26' 25\", W110° 06' 53\"). It might be valuable to know that the trail is not shown correctly on the USGS 7.5' maps. The bottom of the actual trail is located approximately 1/4 mile downstream from where the USGS map shows. Once in the bottom of Grand Gulch begin hiking up canyon and enjoy the scenery. After hiking 1/4 mile you will reach Pollys Canyon (N37° 26' 33\", W110° 06' 45\") entering Grand Gulch from the east (right). Turn east and follow a hiker trail into Pollys Canyon. Within the first 1/4 mile of entering Pollys Canyon you will pass several nice campsites, a spring, and a large arch located high on the east (right) canyon wall. Just keep hiking up canyon following the path of least resistance. 1 1/2 miles after leaving Grand Gulch you will reach a major fork (N37° 26' 19\", W110° 05' 31\") in the canyon. Take the south (right) fork and keep hiking up canyon. Approximately 1/3 mile after leaving the fork you will notice a weakness in the north (left) wall of the canyon that allows you to climb up to the bench above. This weakness is frequently cairned and is the easiest way of reaching a cluster of really nice Anasazi Ruins (N37° 26' 09\", W110° 05' 11\"). The actual ruins themselves are on the north wall and located approximately 1/2 mile above the fork in the canyon on a large bench above the watercourse. If you miss the weakness you will find yourself walking next to a large, water smoothed cliff. The cliff eventually lowers to nearly stream level and allows you some outstanding views of the ruins from the canyon bottom. Approximately 1/4 mile up canyon from the Anasazi ruins you will reach a second major fork (N37° 26' 04\", W110° 04' 52\") in the canyon. Take the south (right) fork and keep hiking up canyon. You will pass a good size spring just after the fork. This next portion of canyon is the trickiest section. You will find yourself doing some bushwhacking and route finding around some minor dryfalls. The route finding is never too difficult provided you look around and are willing to backtrack a little. All the dryfalls can be defeated by bench systems that will allow you to climb around the dryfalls, often these minor detours will be cairned. Approximately 1 1/4 miles up canyon from the second major fork and spring you will break out of the deep canyon at anther minor dryfall (N37° 25' 08\", W110° 04' 25\"). The place is straightforward to identify because it is the first place you will notice where it is easy to climb out of the canyon bottom. Climb out of the canyon bottom to the west (right) and make a beeline west towards the Government Trail Trailhead. This segment of the route consists of hiking 3/4 miles of cross-country. If you look around its not hard to find minor hiker made use trails leading to where you want to go. Try following these use trails where possible to avoid trampling the Cryptobiotic soil and creating braided social trails. Big Man Pictograph Panel: A visit to the Big Man Pictograph Panel can be combined with the Pollys Canyon loop hike. Big Man is one of the larger and better panels of rock art in Grand Gulch. The addition of the Big Man Pictograph Panel to your route will add approximately 2 hours to your adventure.

The ruins themselves are marginal by Butler Wash standards, but the imposing view looking west over Cedar Mesa more then makes up for any short comings the ruins might have. General Information: Ridge Top Ruins are one of the longer Butler Wash hikes. A round trip to visit and explore the ruins will require approximately 3 to 4 hours. The route to Ridge Top Ruin is 2 miles each way with 350 feet of elevation gain. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The area is criss crossed with confusing roads and trails. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Bluff NW\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Ridge Top Ruin is rated 1A II using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Complete information on locating this route is available in the Butler Wash Road Trailhead Guide. Route Information: From the Ridge Top and Split Level Ruin Trailhead (N37° 23' 24\", W109° 37' 34\") follow the obvious ATV track (closed to motorized travel) west for 1/2 mile to a large group of cottonwood trees (N37° 23' 21\", W109° 38' 02\"). At the cottonwood trees the ATV track takes a sharp 90-degree turn north (right) and a well used hiker trail continues west (straight ahead) towards Split Level Ruins. Do not follow the well used hiker trail. Turn north and keep following the ATV track. From the cottonwood trees the ATV track climbs a short steep hill, follows a minor ridge for a short distance and then heads northwest out onto slickrock. Just keep hiking across the slickrock in a northwest direction and if you are good at navigation you will reach the bottom of a canyon (N37° 23' 38\", W109° 38' 20\") and regain the lost ATV track at the same point about 1/2 mile northwest of the cottonwood trees. Once you are in the bottom of the canyon navigation is easy. Just follow the old abandoned ATV track upstream for 1 mile to where it ends at a magnificent viewpoint, at the top of Comb Ridge, overlooking Comb Wash. From where the ATV track ends you will find Ridge Top Ruins (N37° 23' 58\", W109° 39' 05\") 200-yards to the north in the back of a large alcove in the cliff. The water source for this ruin appears to have been a small spring located in the very back of the alcove. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/ridgetop.htm 1/25/2018 Ridge Top Ruin - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/ridgetop.htm 1/25/2018 River House - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] River House Ruin AKA: Snake House Cedar Mesa Anasazi Ruins & Petroglyphs River House is awesome because you get the trifecta - pioneer history, Anasazi ruins and rock art. Best of all it's an adventure the entire family can enjoy. Pioneer History: the route retraces part of the route traveled in 1879 when a group of Mormon pioneers began the now famous Hole-in-the-Rock Expedition. This route visits the historical San Juan Hill and the Barton Trading Post. Anasazi Ruins: River House is one of the better and more photogenic Anasazi ruins to be found in Cedar Mesa. Rock Art: An easy 1 mile hike along the base of a sandstone cliffs will allow you to visit literally hundreds of petroglyph panels containing several thousand individual figures. General Information: River House Ruin is a fun adventure suitable for the entire family. A four wheel drive allows you to drive right to the base of the ruins. Following the pioneer trail and visiting all the attraction along the trail will require about half-a-day. The ruins are impressive and well preserved. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. Spring and fall are the ideal times to visit the area. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route and in locating specific ruins. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"San Juan Hill\" and \"Bluff SW\" show the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The hike to the Butler Wash Petroglyph Panel is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: A four wheel drive vehicle is required to reach River House. A stock four wheel drive truck or SUV should have no problem driving right to the Anasazi ruins in good weather conditions. The route crosses Comb Wash numerous times. The stream flowing down Comb Wash is normally not a problem, but if the water is deep and swift find a different adventure. Camping is available nearby next to the San Juan River. From Bluff, Utah drive west on Highway 191 approximately 4 miles to the junction with Highway 163. Drive west on Highway 163 for 3.1 miles to mile marker 38.3 and a dirt road on the south (left) side of the highway (N37° 15' 58\", W109° 40' 28\"). The dirt road follows the Hole-in-the-Rock pioneer trail nearly all the way to River House Ruin. The trail is marked with small BLM sign posts with a symbol of a covered wagon. You will be following the BLM signs all the way to San Juan Hill. Begin by following the dirt road south. After 0.4 miles you will reach Navajo Springs (N37° 15' 39\", W109° 40' 34\"). Navajo Springs provided a water source and a route for early inhabitant to cross Comb Ridge, but the route was to difficult to take wagons over. From Navajo Springs continue south for 3.5 miles until you reach a junction (N37° 13' 14\", W109° 42' 08\"). The road to the south (straight) takes you to several nice campsites next to the San Juan River. The Hole-in-the-Rock trail turns east (left) and climbs the short hill. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/riverhouse.htm 1/25/2018 River House - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 At the top of the hill the road forks. North (left) leads 0.2 miles to the base of San Juan Hill (N37° 13' 19\", W109° 41' 51\"), South (right) leads 0.4 miles to what is left of the Barton Trading Post (N37° 13' 11\", W109° 41' 42\"). From the Barton Trading Post just keep following the main road east for 0.5 miles to reach River House Ruins (N37° 13' 22\", W109° 41' 17\"). The ruins are easy to see as they are located in a large alcove in the cliff. Route Information: You drive right to the base of River House Ruins. You will find a nice trial that leads up to the ruins, please take only pictures and leave only footprints. If you explore along the ledge that River House is built on you will find several smaller ruins and dozens of petroglyph and several pictograph panels. River House is often referred to as Snake House, because of the large snake pictograph painted on the cliff above the main ruins. If you enjoy rock art you will want to take a short, 1 mile hike east. You can actually drive this road most of the way, but it is not as good as the road to River House, at the very least your vehicle will be scratched. We like to walk the road as it's a short easy hike and it allows us to study many of the rock art panels along the way. Please note, the trail from River House to the Butler Wash Rock Art Panel crosses private property, please use good judgment so as not to jeopardize this access. From River House just follow the main road/trail leading east, the trail has several forks but they all come back together again, just follow the path of least resistance. Approximately 1/2 mile after leaving River House the trail swings next to a dark cliff. This cliff contains numerous petroglyph's (N37° 13' 37\", W109° 40' 43\"). Continue following the trail an additional 1/2 mile and you will arrive at the Butler Wash Petroglyph Panel (N37° 14' 00\", W109° 40' 12\"). This is one of the largest panels of rock art that I know of, it is massive and worth the short hike. History: San Juan Hill - This is the obstacle that finally broke the Hole-in-the-Rock Emigrants. By the time the 236 emigrants reached the base of the hill in the spring of 1880 they had defeated many miles of rugged terrain. Elizabeth Morris Decker, in a letter to her parents, wrote a vivid account of the trek \"...the roughest country you or anybody else ever seen; its nothing in the world but rocks and holes, hills and hollows. The mountains are just one solid rock as smooth as an apple.\" The brave pioneers cut dugways and blasted roads through the slickrock and cut a passable trail through the dense cedar forests. On the north bank of the San Juan River the weary, hungry, and discouraged travelers finally reached the solid rock wall of Comb Ridge and San Juan Hill. According to Lemuel H. Redd Jr, who drove a horse team up the hill, the steep, slick grade took its toll on the exhausted animals and men. Many of the horses went into \"spasms and near-convulsions\" as they battled for footholds on the upward climb. When it was all over \"the worst stretches [on the hill] could be easily identified by the dried blood and matted hair from the forelegs of the struggling teams.\" The pioneers reached the present site of Bluff in April 1880 and set to work establishing a new community.

I also think it is one of the better canyons because you usually have the canyon to yourself. Among the numerous Anasazi ruins to be found in the canyon is the famous Green Mask ruins and pictographs. This canyon also contains a really nice ruin known as Yellow House. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Sheiks Canyon contains many outstanding ruins for day hikers to explore, and provides excellent access into Grand Gulch for those doing multi day backpack trips. This canyon is not recommended for backpackers exiting Grand Gulch because of several steep climbs up loose terrain. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. Spring and fall are the ideal times for this hike. The canyon is very hot in summer and cold in the winter. The time required to hike from the Sheiks Canyon Trailhead to the Green mask Ruins is approximately 3 hours each way, add in time to explore the ruins and you have a full day. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least two liters of water. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route and in locating specific ruins. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Pollys Pasture\" and \"Cedar Mesa North\" show the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. Sheiks Canyon contains a use trail for most of it's length, the trail can be a little difficult to follow in several places if you are not paying attention. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Sheiks Canyon is rated 1A III using the Canyon Rating System. A BLM Backcountry Permit is required to hike Sheiks Canyon. The closest permit station is a self serve station located at the Sheiks Canyon Trailhead. Trailhead Information: This trailhead is accessible to all high clearance vehicles in good weather. The last 1/4 mile of this road gets a little rough. A carefully driven passenger vehicle can probably access all but the final 1/4 mile to the actual trailhead. Camping is available at the trailhead and other nearby locations. From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 28 miles on Utah Highway 95 to the junction of Utah Highway 95 and Utah Highway 261. Travel south on Utah Highway 261 for approximately 10 1/2 miles to mile marker 21.7 and the signed Bullet Canyon Road (N37° 25' 51\", W109° 56' 00\"). Turn west (right) onto the Bullet Canyon Road (SJC 251). Follow the well maintained dirt road for 1.1 miles to the signed Bullet Canyon Trailhead (N37° 25' 50\", W109° 57' 01\"). From the Bullet Canyon Trailhead follow the road north (right) for 1.4 miles to a junction (N37° 27' 03\", W109° 57' 13\"). Turn west (left) and this junction and follow the road (SJC 250) 1.6 miles to the Sheiks Canyon Trailhead. There is a trail register, self-serve permit station, and parking for several vehicles at the trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sheiks.htm 1/25/2018 Sheiks Canyon - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 Route Information: From the Sheiks Canyon Trailhead (N37° 26' 56\", W109° 58' 59\"), follow the shallow drainage west. Approximately 250-yards from the trailhead the drainage will turn northwest and begin to develop. It's hard to get lost from this point on as the route follows the main drainage. As you descend this canyon you will encounter several dryfalls, boulder fields and other minor obstacles. There is always a route through these problems requiring only minor scrambling with little or no exposure. If you find yourself in a difficult position just backtrack a short distance and look for a better route through or around the problem. Just under 1/2 mile from the trailhead you will encounter Yellow House Ruins (N37° 27' 05\", W109° 59' 19\"). I do not know if this is an official name, but it is the name I know the ruins as. The hike to Yellow House and back to the trailhead is a nice short route for those not up to the complete Sheiks Canyon. From Yellow House just keep hiking downstream, you will pass numerous ruins along the way so keep a sharp lookout. All the ruins I know of are correctly noted on the map, these ruins range from a few scattered remnants to outstandingly well preserved archeological finds that will astound you. Green Mask Ruins and Spring are located 2 1/4 miles downstream from Yellow House. Just before you reach Green Mask the canyon drops sharply, the best route is to follow the hiker trail around to the north (right) and follow it down a badly eroded conglomerate slope to the canyon bottom. This badly eroded conglomerate slope is why I discourage backpackers from using Sheiks as an egress. The hike down is not to difficult, but the hike up blows. From the base of the badly eroded conglomerate slope its only a short walk to Green Mask Spring and Ruins (N37° 27' 11\", W110° 01' 20\"). Green Mask Ruins are located in a large alcove on the north (right) side of the canyon. The ruins consist of structures on two levels and hundreds of colorful pictographs painted on the walls and ceiling of the alcove. The actual Green Mask is only about 12\" tall and is located in the far upper right corner of the extensive panel. Backpackers will want to note that Green Mask Spring is one of the better springs in Grand Gulch and that an outstanding campsite is available on the hill opposite the Green Mask Ruins. From the Green Mask Ruins its only a 300-yard hike downstream to the canyons junction with Grand Gulch (N37° 27' 09\", W110° 01' 30\"). Bullet Canyon - Sheiks Canyon Loop: Bullet Canyon combines well with Sheiks Canyon to create an outstanding loop hike. If completing this route as a loop I strongly recommend descending Sheiks Canyon and exiting out Bullet Canyon. The climb up and out of Sheiks is more difficult than climbing up and out of Bullet Canyon. A vehicle shuttle is the best option for completing this loop, a mountain bike shuttle also works extremely well as the trailheads are only 3 miles apart on well maintained dirt roads. As a last resort you can walk the road between trailheads. The best route is to hike down Sheiks Canyon to Grand Gulch, Hike 1 1/2 miles down Grand Gulch to Bullet Canyon, Hike up Bullet Canyon. This loop will require approximately 8 to 9 hours to complete.

Unlike most of the majestic Anasazi ruins in Grand Gulch, Slickhorn Canyon was not raped and pillaged by Richard Wetherill and other pot hunters in the late 1800's. The route described visits one of the most outstanding Anasazi ruins in Cedar Mesa; known as \"Slickhorn Perfect Kiva\". Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: The Slickhorn Canyon route visits one of the most well preserved kivas in Cedar Mesa. The route is accessible year round in good weather. Sections of this route could be difficult if there is snow on the ground. Spring and fall are the ideal times for this hike. This route is very hot in summer and cold in the winter. It is helpful to understand that the Slickhorn Canyon drainage contains numerous tributaries. The loop hike described below descends what is commonly known as Slickhorn #1 and exits Slickhorn #2. The Slickhorn Canyon Loop Hike is rated 2A III using the Canyon Rating System. The time required for the loop hike is approximately 7 hours. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least two liters of water. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route and in locating specific waypoints and ruins. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Pollys Pasture\", \"Slickhorn Canyon East\", \"Cedar Mesa South\" and \"Cedar Mesa North\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. Slickhorn Canyon contains a use trail for most of its length. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Slickhorn #1 Trailhead Information: The Slickhorn #1 Trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in good weather. Primitive camping is available at the trailhead. From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 28 miles on Utah Highway 95 to the junction of Utah Highway 95 and Utah Highway 261. Travel south on Utah Highway 261 for approximately 13 miles to mile marker 19.1 and a well maintained, unsigned, dirt road heading west (N37° 23' 47\", W109° 56' 38\"). This unsigned dirt road is opposite the signed Cigarette Springs Road which heads east. Turn west (right) onto the unsigned dirt road and follow it for 2.4 miles to a fork signed \"Government Trail\" (N37° 24' 26\", W109° 58' 52\"). Do not follow the road to Government Trail, instead turn south (left) and follow the road for 1.6 miles to a small unsigned spur road (N37° 23' 29\", W110° 00' 07\") heading west (right) . Turn west (right) and follow the small unsigned spur road for 0.4 miles to the Slickhorn #1 trailhead. The trailhead contains an information kiosk and a BLM trail register. Slickhorn #2 Trailhead Information: If you have a second vehicle or a mountain bike you can eliminate 1 1/2 miles of road http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/slickhorn.htm 1/25/2018 Slickhorn Canyon - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 walking by setting up a shuttle at the Slickhorn #2 trailhead. The Slickhorn #2 Trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in good weather. Primitive camping is available near the trailhead. From the Slickhorn #1 Trailhead you need to follow the small unsigned spur road for 0.4 miles back to the main road. At the main road turn south (right) and follow the road 1.4 miles to the Slickhorn #2 trailhead, which is indentified as the point where the wash crosses the road. Route Information: From the Slickhorn #1 Trailhead (N37° 23' 23\", W110° 00' 30\"), follow the wash west. After 1 1/2 miles of easy hiking down the wash bottom you will encounter a impressive dryfall (N37° 22' 57\", W110° 01' 57\") that is the biggest obstacle you will encounter on the route. Getting around the dryfall is not really difficult if you follow instructions. From the top of the dryfall you need to scramble south (left) up to the next major bench. The correct bench is easy to identify as it is guarded by a large hoodoo that appears to be wearing a hat. Once on the bench follow it down canyon for about 1/4 mile to where it pinches down and comes to an end. Near the very end of the bench you will locate a weakness that allows you to scramble down to the next level. The weakness is difficult to see until you are almost standing on top of it. The entire bypass route is normally well cairned so a sharp eye might help you navigate this section. Once you have located the weakness just scramble down the typical Cedar Mesa wedding cake tiered sandstone to the bottom of the canyon (N37° 22' 43\", W110° 02' 03\"). After you have reached the canyon bottom hike downstream approximately 300-yards to where you can gain access to Slickhorn Perfect Kiva (N37° 22' 42\", W110° 02' 14\"). Slickhorn Perfect Kiva is located on the west (right) side of the canyon at the base of a large cliff in a great alcove. From the canyon floor you can't see the ruins, but the obvious alcove is easy to locate. You must scramble up to the alcove. The route up to the ruins is never difficult if you take a few minutes and exercise good route finding skills. After visiting Slickhorn Perfect Kiva continue hiking downstream and enjoy the scenery. After 1 1/2 miles of easy hiking in the canyon bottom you will reach the confluence of Slickhorn #1 and Slickhorn #2 (N37° 21' 57\", W110° 02' 55\"). At the confluence you will find several panels of rock art and a well preserved granary to the west (right) along the base of the obvious cliff. Both the rock art and granary are easy to locate. The rock art consists of both pictographs and petroglyphs. After visiting the rock art and granary turn east (left) and begin hiking up Slickhorn #2. You will encounter some minor scrambling through boulder fields and over dryfalls in this next section. Hike upstream 1 1/4 miles and you will reach the confluence of Slickhorn #2 and Slickhorn #3 (N37° 22' 14\", W110° 01' 53\"). Take the north (left) fork and continue hiking upstream for 2 1/4 miles to the Slickhorn #2 trailhead (N37° 22' 23\", W109° 59' 50\"). From the Slickhorn #2 Trailhead its a simple 1 1/2 mile hike or shuttle north back to the Slickhorn #1 trailhead. BLM Backcountry Permit: A BLM Backcountry Permit is required to hike Slickhorn Canyon. The closest permit station is a self serve station located 0.3 miles off of Highway 191 as your drive to the trailhead. You will drive right next to this permit station on your way to the trailhead.

The ruins contain numerous note worthy structures and assorted pictographs and petroglyphs. This ruin is easy to access. General Information: Split Level requires a short hike. A round trip to visit and explore the ruins will require approximately 2 hours. The route to Split Level is 3/4 miles each way with minor elevation gain. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. A pair of binoculars will prove beneficial when exploring these ruins. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The area is criss crossed with confusing roads and trails. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Bluff NW\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Split Level is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Complete information on locating this route is available in the Butler Wash Road Trailhead Guide. Route Information: From the Split Level and Ridge Top Ruin Trailhead (N37° 23' 24\", W109° 37' 34\") follow the obvious ATV track (closed to motorized travel) west for 1/2 mile to a large group of cottonwood trees (N37° 23' 21\", W109° 38' 02\"). At the cottonwood trees the ATV track takes a sharp 90-degree turn north and heads towards Ridge Top Ruins, do not keep following the ATV track. At the 90-degree turn keep walking west (straight ahead) on a well used hiker trail. Follow the hiker trail as it drops steeply into a wash. Once in the bottom of the wash hike downstream 30-yards to where a second wash enters from the west (right). Turn and follow the second wash upstream (west) as it snakes back into Comb Ridge. 1/4 mile after leaving the ATV track and dropping into the wash you will notice a well used trail branching south (left) and climbing up the side of the canyon to a large alcove (N37° 23' 19\", W109° 38' 16\"). This large alcove contains a number of pictographs, most of them are the typical handprints prevalent throughout Butler Wash. Form where the trail branch's off to the large alcove just keep following the main trail up the lush wash bottom for an additional 250-yards to Split Level Ruins (N37° 23' 25\", W109° 38' 22\"). The ruins are located on two levels, the bottom level is easy to access if you follow the main trail. Behind the foremost wall of the lower ruins is a massive cave, unfortunately the cave has been hit hard by pothunters and grave robbers. You will find countless pictographs and petroglyphs on the cliff walls around this entire area. The petroglyph some call \"Long Fingers\" or \"Spaceman Hands\" is found on the west side of the lower level. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/splitlevel.htm 1/25/2018 Split Level Ruin - Cedar Mesa - Hiking Page 2 of 2 The upper ruins are difficult to access but can be reached from up canyon by those so inclined. The upper ruins contain several large structures and a couple of very interesting green target pictographs painted on the back wall. The upper ruins can be easily viewed from a high point on the main trail leading to the ruins. A pair of binoculars will allow you to view the ruins up close and examine most of the pictographs painted on the upper walls. Rock Art: Rock art consists of two major categories, pictographs and petroglyphs. Symbols which are painted onto the rock are pictographs. Symbols which are carved, scratched or chipped into the rock are petroglyphs. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

This is the model suburban Anasazi household. General Information: Tower House is a very well preserved ruin that is hidden in an easy to reach canyon. A round trip to visit and explore the ruins will require approximately 1 or 2 hours. The route is less then 1/4 mile and might require some very minor scrambling. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. The ruins are accessible year round in good weather. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The area is criss- crossed with confusing roads and trails. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Hotel Rock\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Tower House is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Any vehicle can access this trailhead in good weather. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Camping is available in several locations near the trailhead. From Blanding, Utah travel south on Utah Highway 191 for 3 miles to the junction of Utah Highway 191 and Utah Highway 95. Travel west 6 miles on Utah Highway 95 to mile marker 115 and the signed South Cottonwood Canyon Road (N37° 33' 46\", W109° 35' 01\"). Turn north (right) onto the South Cottonwood Canyon Road (SJC 228). Follow the well maintained dirt road for 0.9 miles to a junction (N37° 34' 30\", W109° 35' 30\"). Take the west (left) fork (SJC 240) and drive an additional 4.0 miles. You should see a turn- out/ATV track on the south (left) side of the road that will accommodated several vehicles. This is the Tower House Trailhead. Route Information: From the Tower House Trailhead (N37° 34' 57\", W109° 39' 26\") hike southeast a short distance until you intersect a slickrock canyon. The trick to accessing this ruin is locating the correct approach canyon. You will know you are in the correct canyon if the north rim is guarded by a hoodoo with a balanced rock on top. Hike down the slickrock canyon to a lush grotto bottom. Tower House (N37° 34' 51\", W109° 39' 08\") is tucked into the north alcove of the lush grotto.

General Information: Angel Cove and Angel Cove - South Fork are both technical canyoneering routes that require complete technical gear. Both these slot canyons are accessible year-round unless there is snow on the ground. Both Angel Cove and Angel Cove South Fork are rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 3 to 4 hours for each canyon. In normal conditions both canyons are dry and do not require swimming or wading. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Angel Cove\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for Angel Cove use the WGS84 datum. The longest rappel is 70-feet. A 50-meter rope is suggested for this route. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A very small pack is also a good idea with this route. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchor and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: A passenger car should be able to access to within 1/4 mile of the actual trailhead in normal conditions. The area is crisscrossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. 4x4 vehicles can drive to the actual trailhead. Drive south out of Hanksville on highway 95 to mile marker 10.1 (N38° 14' 09\" W110° 38' 52\") and the signed \"Angel Trail\" road located on the east (left) side of the highway. Turn east on the Angel Trail Road and follow it for 2.4 miles to a junction (N38° 14' 32\" W110° 36' 38\"). Turn north (left) at the junction and follow the road for 6.0 miles to where a small 4x4 road enters from the east (right) side (N38° 18' 48\" W110° 33' 05\"). Turn east on this small 4x4 road and follow it for 0.3 miles to a small parking area on the north (left) side. This is the trailhead for Angel Cove. Main Fork Route Information: From the Angel Cove Trailhead (N38° 19' 00\", W110° 32' 49\"), hike due north and into the drainage immediately in front of you. Continue down the canyon until your first rappel of 35- feet, which is anchored from a large rock. This first rappel almost looks like a downclimb. Shortly thereafter is a second rappel of 15-feet, which is anchored by a large chokestone. To start this rappel you will have to downclimb to the far side of the large chokestone where you can reach the webbing. This drop might be a downclimb for some. There will be several short http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/angelcove.htm 1/25/2018 Angel Cove - Dirty Devil - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 downclimbs and then you will encounter the third rappel of 30-feet. Shortly after this the South Fork enters from the right. See Main and South Fork Information below for completion of the route. South Fork Route Information: From the Angel Cove Trailhead (N38° 19' 00\", W110° 32' 49\") hike east and slightly south to the head of the South Fork (N38° 18' 55\" W110° 32' 33\"). Head downstream and you will soon encounter a 15-foot rappel with a very awkward start. Continue down canyon until stopped by a 50-foot dryfall that you must rappel. From the bottom of this rappel, hike a short distance down canyon to your next rappel, which is 40-feet. The rappel is anchored from a large boulder. Continue down canyon enjoying a few downclimbs until you come to your next rappel of 30- feet. A short distance further you will come to a rappel that looks to be a downclimb but the second half of it is too wide. Downclimb until you are under a large chokestone, then drape your rope around the chokestone and rappel from it. Be careful not to wedge your rope between the chokestone and the canyon wall; this shouldn't be a problem for most canyoneers. After this there are several downclimbs, one of which is intimidating; however, it can be done if you take your time and think about your moves. Soon the canyon joins the Main Fork. See Main and South Fork Information below for completion of the route. Main Fork and South Fork Information: At the confluence of the Main Fork and South Fork of Angel Cove, continue downstream. The canyon has many more downclimbs as the slot narrows and deepens. Soon the canyon will open, and if you look high on the south (right) wall you will see an arch. There is a nice view of the Dirty Devil from here. Proceed downstream to a 50-foot dryfall. The anchor for this rappel is from a large cairn. After this obstacle, you are immediately presented with a very delightful 70- foot rappel into a pleasing alcove. Try to keep your rope out of the rope-eating crack. Hike down canyon and look for a hiker trail traversing the Dirty Devil. Once you intersect the trail, follow it downstream. Follow the trail as it starts to ascend a sand bank. Shortly you will notice the canyon wall on your west (right) becomes gradual and a few side trails lead to your exit. Take the one with the easiest slickrock exit and hike up to the next bench. This is the level you would be on if you skipped the last two rappels of Angel Cove. In front of you will be a large canyon wall which makes escape impossible. Keep hiking a few minutes down canyon until it is possible to hike up steep slick rock and climb up onto the next bench level. Keep hiking west and trend towards your left and locate a large sandstone pocket. Hike to the left of the pocket (N38° 18' 52\" W110° 32' 06\"). Hike up steep slickrock following ridges trending right and then up the path of least resistance until you reach the next bench. At this point you should be able to see a large point with two pillars and a window in red rock. Hike towards this. To the right of the pillars will be a red stained streak. Hike 100-feet to the right of this streak, up steep and exposed slickrock to the north (right) of this streak until you reach a narrow ledge at the base of the cliff. Be sure of your footing. Traverse west (left) until you can escape easily onto the rim above. Hike up the slope until you reach a flat area. You will then want to hike along this flat area until you can cross the head of the South Fork Angel Cove (N38° 18' 55\" W110° 32' 33\"). Hike back to the trailhead.

Often such banishment is a punishment for disobeying or rebelling against God. Since this slot was the last of the Angel Canyons to be explored it was referred to as the fallen angel. General Information: Fallen Angel is a technical canyoneering route that requires complete technical gear. This canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Fallen Angel is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 3 to 4 hours. In normal conditions this canyon is dry and does not require swimming or wading. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Angel Cove\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for Fallen Angel use the WGS84 datum. The longest rappel is 100-feet. A 60-meter rope is suggested for this route. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system.

Turn east on the Angel Trail Road and follow it for 2.4 miles to a junction (N38° 14' 32\" W110° 36' 38\"). Turn north (left) at the junction and follow the road for 6.0 miles to where a small 4x4 road enters from the east (right) side (N38° 18' 48\" W110° 33' 05\"). Turn east on this small 4x4 road and follow it for 0.3 miles to a small parking area to your north (left) side. This is the trailhead for Angel Cove. Route Information: From the Angel Cove Trailhead (N38° 19' 00\", W110° 32' 49\"), hike due north and cross the drainage immediately in front of you, which is the main fork of Angel Cove. After hiking the steep slope head north along the rim top until you encounter a drainage. This is the head of Fallen Angel (N38° 19' 22\" W110° 32' 52\"). Head downstream for approximately 10 minutes to where the bottom drops out of the canyon. This is the first rappel. The rappel is 90-feet and the anchor is from a large rock. From the bottom of the rappel continue downstream and you will encounter a 30-foot rappel. Shortly thereafter you encounter a 60-foot rappel from a large boulder. Continue downstream and you will encounter a 100-foot double stage rappel. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/angelfallen.htm 1/25/2018 Fallen Angel - Dirty Devil - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 At the bottom of the double stage rappel you will encounter a spicy downclimb or slide, which you might want to protect with a handline. At the bottom of this downclimb is another downclimb onto a large boulder. This boulder may have to be your anchor for the final rappel of 70-feet. Currently the anchor for the final rappel is a dicey stack of rocks. To sling the large boulder will require at least 50 feet of webbing. There are very few other anchors available in this section. After the final rappel there are a couple of downclimbs until the canyon abruptly ends. When the slot ends, continue down stream until you encounter a 70-foot rappel, and shortly after you will encounter an awkward 15-foot rappel that places you at the end of the canyon. Locate a hiker trail along the Dirty Devil River. Head downstream along the Dirty Devil on this trail the west canyon wall will be tall and impressive. Locate an arch type feature low on the wall and look for petroglyphs to the right of it. If you follow the trail along the Dirty Devil it is possible to stay out of the river. When you reach the exit of Angel Cove continue downstream on this trail. Follow the trail as it starts to ascend a sand bank. Shortly you will notice the canyon wall on your west (right) becomes gradual and a few side trails lead to your exit. Take the one with the easiest slickrock exit and hike up to the next bench. This is the level you would be on if you skipped the last two rappels of Angel Cove. In front of you will be a large canyon wall which makes escape impossible. Keep hiking a few minutes down canyon until it is possible to hike up steep slick rock and climb up onto the next bench level. Keep hiking west and trend towards your left and locate a large sandstone pocket. Hike to the left of the pocket (N38° 18' 52\" W110° 32' 06\"). Hike up steep slickrock following ridges trending right and then up the path of least resistance until you reach the next bench. At this point you should be able to see a large point with two pillars and a window in red rock. Hike towards this. To the right of the pillars will be a red stained streak. Hike 100-feet to the right of this streak, up steep and exposed slickrock to the north (right) of this streak until you reach a narrow ledge at the base of the cliff. Be sure of your footing. Traverse west (left) until you can escape easily onto the rim above. Hike up the slope until you reach a flat area. You will then want to hike along this flat area until you can cross the head of the South Fork Angel Cove (N38° 18' 55\" W110° 32' 33\"). Hike back to the trailhead.

This canyon is a nice addition to the other slot canyons in the Angel area along the Dirty Devil. This route description also details a simple and easy access to the challenging slot canyon known as Chambers in Robbers Roost. General Information: Lost Angel is a technical canyoneering route that requires complete technical gear. This canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Lost Angel is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 2 to 4 hours. In normal conditions this canyon is dry and does not require swimming or wading. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Angel Cove\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for Lost Angel use the WGS84 datum. The longest rappel is 110-feet. Two 120-foot ropes are suggested for this route. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchor and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: A passenger car should be able to access to within 1/4 mile of the actual trailhead in normal conditions. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. 4x4 vehicles can drive to the actual trailhead. Drive south out of Hanksville on highway 95 to mile marker 10.1 (N38° 14' 09\" W110° 38' 52\") and the signed \"Angel Trail\" road located on the east (left) side of the highway. Turn east on the Angel Trail Road and follow it for 2.4 miles to a junction (N38° 14' 32\" W110° 36' 38\"). Turn north (left) at the junction and follow the road for 6.0 miles to where a small 4x4 road enters from the east (right) side (N38° 18' 48\" W110° 33' 05\"). Turn east on this small 4x4 road and follow it for 0.3 miles to a small parking area to your north (left) side. This is the trailhead for Angel Cove. Route Information: From the Angel Cove Trailhead (N38° 19' 00\", W110° 32' 49\"), find a trail leading into the immediate drainage to the north, which is the main fork of Angel Cove. Cross this drainage heading north and work your way to the rim of the canyon. Once on top of the rim continue hiking north, skirting the head of the drainage known as Fallen Angel (N38° 19' 22\" W110° 32' 52\"), until you arrive at the head of Lost Angel (N38° 19' 35\" W110° 32' 48\"). Hike down canyon until you reach a large dryfall. This is the first rappel, it is 70-feet and anchored from a tree. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/angellost.htm 1/25/2018 Lost Angel - Dirty Devil - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 Immediately downstream is the second rappel, it is 20-feet and can be downclimbed by the skilled or foolish. Continue downstream until you encounter a low-angle rappel of 35-feet. Downclimb to your next rappel, which is a two-staged rappel anchored from a chokestone. The two-stage rappel is 65-feet. Next up is a 20-foot rappel. Look back over your shoulder to the southwest high up on the canyon wall and you will see a large arch. Continue downstream until you reach a very impressive 110-foot rappel, which is anchored from a very large dead man in a pothole. Hike downstream until you reach the Dirty Devil. At the confluence of the Dirty Devil hike downstream. Soon you will pass the exit of Fallen Angel. At this point the west canyon wall will be tall and impressive. Locate an arch type feature low on the wall and look for petroglyphs to the right of it. These are best viewed from a distance. After this Angel Cove will enter into the Dirty Devil. Locate a hiker trail by the exit of Angel Cove and follow the trail as it starts to ascend a sand bank. Shortly you will notice the canyon wall on your west (right) becomes gradual and a few side trails lead to your exit. Take the one with the easiest slickrock exit and hike up to the next bench. This is the level you would be on if you skipped the last two rappels of Angel Cove. In front of you will be a large canyon wall which makes escape impossible. Keep hiking a few minutes down canyon until it is possible to hike up steep slick rock and climb up onto the next bench level. Keep hiking west and trend towards your left and locate a large sandstone pocket. Hike to the left of the pocket (N38° 18' 52\" W110° 32' 06\"). Hike up steep slickrock following ridges trending right and then up the path of least resistance until you reach the next bench. At this point you should be able to see a large point with two pillars and a window in red rock. Hike towards this. To the right of the pillars will be a red stained streak. Hike 100-feet to the right of this streak, up steep and exposed slickrock to the north (right) of this streak until you reach a narrow ledge at the base of the cliff. Be sure of your footing. Traverse west (left) until you can escape easily onto the rim above. Hike up the slope until you reach a flat area. You will then want to hike along this flat area until you can cross the head of the South Fork Angel Cove (N38° 18' 55\" W110° 32' 33\"). Hike back to the trailhead. Full Meal Deal: At the Confluence of Lost Angel and the Dirty Devil, those that know how to read a map will notice a canyon on the far side of the Dirty Devil known as Chambers. Chambers is for experienced canyoneers only and is rated 3A II R using the Canyon Rating System. Combining Lost Angel and Chambers into a single route makes for a nice day and allows easy passenger vehicle access to Chambers without having to drive deep into the heart of Robbers Roost with a four-wheel-drive.

Proof that good things come in a small package. General Information: Angel Slot is a technical canyoneering route that requires complete technical gear. This canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Angel Slot is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 3 to 4 hours. In normal conditions this canyon is dry and does not require swimming or wading. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Angel Cove\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for Angel Slot use the WGS84 datum. The longest rappel is 90-feet. A 60-meter rope is suggested for this route. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A very small pack is also a good idea with this route. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchor and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: A passenger car should be able to access this trailhead in normal conditions. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Drive south out of Hanksville on highway 95 to mile marker 10.1 (N38° 14' 09\" W110° 38' 52\") and the signed \"Angel Trail\" road located on the east (left) side of the highway. Turn east on the Angel Trail Road and follow it for 2.4 miles to a junction (N38° 14' 32\" W110° 36' 38\"). Turn north (left) at the junction and follow the road for 5.7 miles to where a road enters from the east (right) side (N38° 18' 29\" W110° 33' 05\"). Turn east on this road and follow it for 0.2 miles to a large parking area. This is the trailhead for Angel Slot. The trailhead contains a BLM trail register and excellent views of the Dirty Devil and Robbers Roost. Route Information: From the Angel Slot Trailhead (N38° 18' 21\", W110° 32' 54\"), hike down the nice trail for five minutes until you reach a small flat area (N38° 18' 12\", W110° 32' 43\"). At this point turn west (right) and drop into Angel Slot. Hike downstream to the first rappel (N38° 18' 07\" W110° 32' 44\"). The first rappel is 70-feet, and is anchored from a large boulder. From the bottom of the first rappel continue hiking downstream to the second rappel, which is a double stage 85-foot rappel anchored from a large boulder. Next you will encounter several fun downclimbs. One of these downclimbs will be a 50-foot rappel for the less skilled. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/angelslot.htm 1/25/2018 Angel Slot - Dirty Devil - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 The start of this downclimb is easy, however it widens near the bottom with an awkward transition. At this point the canyon is dark and impressive. Hike downstream and enjoy the canyon before it opens out into the desert. Note: if you are not big on rappels or are looking for a shorter day its possible to exit to the east (left) at this point and intersect the pack trail leading back to the trailhead. This will shorten your day by about one hour. After the canyon opens up just keep hiking downstream for a short distance and you will arrive at an impressive 90-foot rappel anchored from a stack of rocks. Most of this rappel is free hanging and is massively undercut. Directly in front of you is Beaver Canyon (N38° 17' 38\", W110° 32' 24\"). When finished with the final rappel hike up the large sand hill on the east (left) side and locate a hiker trail. Follow this hiker trail until you reach the first weakness that allows ascent to a flat bench and the area above the final 90-foot rappel. Hike up Angel Slot for a few minutes until you locate a reasonable slickrock exit out of the canyon. Route find in a northwest direction following an occasional cairn until you intersect the pack trail you initially started on. Follow the pack trail back to the trailhead.

This incredible canyon is off the beaten path, which has allowed it to remain hidden to all but the most intrepid canyoneers. But thanks to some enterprising canyoneers with the desire to explore the unknown this canyon's captivating secrets are now unlocked for you to enjoy. General Information: The South Fork of Aardvark Canyon will be presented as the standard route and the North Fork will be presented below as the optional route. The Aardvark Canyon is a spectacular technical canyoneering adventure tucked into a remote section of Grand Staircase - Escalante National Monument. The slot canyon is rated 3B III R using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 7 to 8 hours. Add one hour to your overall time if you are not using a shuttle vehicle. This canyon should only be attempted by advanced canyoneers in excellent physical condition. This is a physically demanding canyon requiring constant downclimbing, squeezing, and chimneying. Spring and fall are the preferred season for completing this route. Aardvark Canyon requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon has the ability to hold a large amount of water and full wetsuits are required. You will encounter several sections of wading and swimming. This route contains one keeper pothole and one semi- keeper pothole. Both potholes can be defeated with teamwork under all conditions. Aardvark Canyon contains several rappels, the longest rappel is 125-feet. Two 140-ropes are recommended for this route as some of the rappels can be difficult to anchor. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, several rapid links and a prusik system. You will need a minimum of 100-feet of webbing if anchors have been washed out or need replacing. A GPS is extremely useful and recommended for locating key waypoints. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Pioneer Mesa\" and \"King Bench\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Aardvark Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Natural Anchors: There are no bolted anchors in Aardvark Canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You will likely need to locate and construct natural anchors which can be difficult in this canyon due to lack of building materials. You might need to harvest rocks from above or below a rappel in order to build an anchor. Trailhead Information: Both South Fork and North Fork use the same trailheads. A high clearance 4x4 is required http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/aardvark.htm 1/25/2018 Aardvark Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 to access the Aardvark Canyon Trailhead. The road to the trailhead is rarely graded so go prepared for difficult road conditions. Occasionally fallen boulders will block the road preventing vehicle access. A vehicle shuttle is recommended but not required for this route. Doing this route without a shuttle vehicle will add 1.9 miles of slogging between the trailheads and will add approximately one hour to your day. From the south end of Boulder, Utah head east on the Burr Trail Road. Follow the Burr Trail Road 18.4 miles to where a dirt road heads west (N37° 55' 27\", W111° 13' 14\". Turn west (right) and follow the dirt road for 4.2 miles as it swings south. Along this dirt road you will find several good primitive campsites. The dirt road will end and you will enter a wash (N37° 52' 00\", W111° 13' 35\"), that is graded for most of the distance to the trailhead. Follow the wash south for an additional 7.0 miles until you arrive at the Lower Aardvark Canyon Trailhead (N37° 48' 09\", W111° 15' 38\"), which is identified by a canyon entering from the east. Park a shuttle vehicle here, then drive an additional 1.9 miles to the Upper Aardvark Canyon Trailhead (N37° 47' 10\", W111° 16' 10\"), which really has no easy to identify feature and is why a GPS is highly recommended for this route. South Fork Route Information: From the Upper Aardvark Trailhead look to the southeast and you will see a distinct crack in the Wingate sandstone (N37° 47' 09\", W111° 16' 08\") that marks the start of the route. There is a path leading to the base of the crack, if you can't see the path, then you are in the wrong place. Climbing up the crack is easy and has minimal exposure. Once at the top of the crack, follow the sandstone ridge to the northeast. All of the moves on the way to the top of the mesa are easy. If you find yourself doing any 5th class climbing, or anything with exposure, then you are in the wrong place. Once at the top of the mesa hike in a northeast direction across the top of Wolverine Bench. Do your best to stay off of the cryptobiotic soil. Cows have never visited the top of the mesa and it contains some of the most pristine cryptobiotic soil and plants you will see in the desert. Please do your part to preserve this area. After approximately 3 miles or 1 1/2 hours of hiking you will arrive at the top of the South Fork of Aardvark Canyon. Enter the canyon by walking down a sandstone ramp (N37° 48' 27\", W111°, 14' 00\") and let the fun begin. The top of Aardvark Canyon contains a fair bit of bushwhacking, potholes, and a couple of short rappels. With minimal effort many of these obstacles can be bypassed by going up and around. This is suggested, because the real action is lower in the canyon. Soon you will arrive at a large distinct chamber, which is a nice place to have lunch. Just after the chamber is a difficult downclimb or easy rappel into a pitch black slot. It's nice to have a couple of headlamps here to aid people through. After another couple of hours of amazing narrows and fun potholes you will arrive at the confluence of the north and south forks of Aardvark Canyon (N37° 48' 13\", W111° 15' 13\"). The confluence is marked by a very large pool. At this junction you can rappel from a small tree located high above the slot. If you can't climb up to the tree, you will be forced to build a deadman far back from the drop. The final rappel is just below the confluence. The rappel can be tricky to anchor and requires some consideration. Building a deadman at this rappel is recommended because of the geometry of the drop. Building materials at the top of the rappel are scarce, so you might have to farm rocks from below. Expect to spend at least an hour at this rappel building and testing your anchor. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/aardvark.htm 1/25/2018 Aardvark Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 The final rappel runs along a rope-eating crack. When pulling your rope take care not to let your rappel rope fall into the crack. When pulling your ropes please stand as far away from the base of the rappel as possible in order to prevent rope grooves. From the bottom of the final rappel scramble over some boulders and back to your shuttle vehicle at the Lower Aardvark Trailhead. Optional North Fork Route Information: North Aardvark Canyon is an outstanding adventure best suited for advanced canyoneers. It is similar to the South Fork in quality, while being just slightly shorter. The canyon is rated a 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. Wetsuits are required, even in the hottest weather. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 7 to 8 hours. Add one hour to your time if you are not using a shuttle vehicle. The approach to North Fork is similar to the South Fork. As you near the drop in for South Fork veer to the east and hike around the head of South Fork. Approximately 5 miles or 2½ to 3 hours after leaving the trailhead you will find yourself heading down into the North Fork of Aardvark Canyon. Navigating the last couple hundred feet is tricky; you will find yourself bushwhacking through a hallway that has openings which give great view down into the slot. Do not rappel from any of these windows, instead, continue bushwhacking north until you can walk down into the bottom of North Fork (N37° 48' 35\", W111° 14' 40\"). Let the fun begin. This is a dynamic canyon, meaning when water levels change the anchoring solutions will also change. Go prepared with webbing and clever solutions. Rappelling from stone horns is recommended in this canyon. Please don’t use sloppy technique and pull a rope around any stone horn and leave a groove, please use webbing instead. As you walk downcanyon you will soon encounter a three-stage drop that ends in a very long perfectly straight hallway. Using whatever method suits you best, rappel your way down the drop. No stage is more than 40-feet. Walk down the intensely beautiful hallway and enjoy how easy it is. The canyon gets much more challenging after this section. Soon the canyon will get very skinny. Large frame canyoneers will be forced about 15 feet over the slot. The stemming is never very dangerous, but it is a lot of work. Next comes a series of short rappels into pools of varying size. Do your best to leave rope grooves when you retrieve your ropes. Once you begin encountering pools that are more than waist deep, go ahead and put your wetsuit on. The pools only get deeper and colder as you proceed further into the slot. Soon you will arrive at a tall elevator downclimb into a pool, then another taller downclimb into an even bigger pool. This is the confluence of the north and south forks of Aardvark Canyon. See the South Fork description above for the remainder of the canyon.

The canyon is often overshadowed by Neon, its glamorous brother to the north. But Baker has numerous delights of its own and should not be over looked. The canyon contains two forks, the beautiful West Fork and the extremely challenging East Fork. General Information: Baker is a wonderful canyon tucked into a corner of the Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument. The canyon contains many delights for the technical canyoneer. Baker Canyon requires complete technical gear. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. Summer would be miserable. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Egypt\" and \"Scorpion Gulch\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Baker Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. In normal conditions this canyon holds a large amount of water and full wetsuits are required. You will encounter several sections of swimming and wading. West Fork of Baker: West Fork of Baker Canyon is rated 3B IV using the Canyon Rating System. This slot is also known as \"Nasty Ass\", which is the acronym for \"Not Another Squeeze Thank You, Another Squeeze Sucker.\" Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 13 to 16 hours of actual hiking time (7 to 11 hours from the mouth of Neon Canyon). A bivouac near the mouth of Neon Canyon and the Escalante River is a popular option for a more enjoyable and shorter day. The route contains several rappels with the longest being 50-feet. A 100-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. East Fork of Baker: East Fork of Baker Canyon is rated 4B IV R using the Canyon Rating System. This slot is also known as \"Tight Ass\". This route is for advanced canyoneers only. Every member of your group must be a skilled canyoneer. This canyon could be deadly for beginners, even with advanced leadership. The following description is not a substitute for commonsense and experience. Do not underestimate the difficulty of descending this canyon. You have been warned! http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/baker.htm 1/25/2018 Baker Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 14 to 17 hours of actual hiking time (8 to 12 hours from the mouth of Neon Canyon). A bivouac near the mouth of Neon Canyon and the Escalante River is a popular option for a more enjoyable and shorter day. The route contains several rappels with the longest being 50-feet. A 100-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. Create Your Own Meal: Baker Canyon is usually completed in combination with one or more other routes. Neon, Ringtail, Baker, Top Chef and Choprock are all accessed from the bottom of Fence Canyon on the Escalante River. The typical combo platter is to backpack down to the Escalante River and set up a base camp somewhere along the river between Fence Canyon and Neon Canyon. There is good camping at the mouth of Neon. One of the best spots shaded by a tree is almost always taken. You can hike up Neon for a short distance and find several good campsites. The area around Fence Canyon was blown out with a massive flood in 2006 and has lots of campsites, but these are not always shaded from the sun. You will pass several nice campsites between Fence and Neon. Additionally there are campsites below Neon on both sides of the river. You have several options for obtaining water in the area. If the Escalante is running clear you can pump water from it. During spring runoff and after large upstream storms the Escalante is very silty and not really pumpable. If that is the case you can usually locate clean water at the mouth of Fence Canyon or by hiking 10 minutes up Neon to a seep/spring. You will be dodging poison ivy to get at the source of the cleanest water. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road and travel 16.5 miles to a turn-off signed \"Egypt\" on the east (left) side of the road. Follow the Egypt Road for 9.5 miles to a fork in the road. Take the east (right) fork and drive 0.5 miles to the Egypt Trailhead. There is reasonable primitive camping along the last 2 miles of the Egypt Road. The trailhead is accessible to all high clearance 2wd vehicles in normal weather conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Route Information: From the Egypt Trailhead (N37° 35' 35\", W111° 13' 07\") follow the cairned route northeast as it descends to a wash that forms Fence Canyon. Follow the north edge of the wash, as the canyon deepens, until the North Fork of Fence Canyon joins and forces you to descend the trail into Fence Canyon. Hike down Fence Canyon to its confluence with the Escalante River (N37° 36' 44\", W111° 10' 44\"). It is 3 miles from the Egypt Trailhead to the Escalante River. From the mouth of Fence Canyon hike downstream 1 mile to the mouth of Neon Canyon (N37° 36' 23\", W111° 10' 05\") entering from the east (left). It requires about 2 1/2 hours to hike down to the mouth of Neon Canyon and 3 hours to hike back up to the trailhead. Near the mouth of Neon Canyon is a popular place to camp for those using more than one day to complete the route. From the mouth of Neon Canyon hike down the Escalante for 1 mile and you will see a small side canyon known as Ringtail Canyon (N37° 35' 59\", W111° 09' 25\") entering from the east (left). From the mouth of Ringtail Canyon continue hiking down the Escalante for 2 1/2 miles. The trick is to find the short slickrock access ramp (N37° 34' 54\" W111° 08' 07\") without hiking the last half mile to Baker Canyon and having to backtrack. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/baker.htm 1/25/2018 Baker Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 The short slickrock access ramp is located on the north (left) side of the canyon and is the only reasonable place to escape the Escalante River in the area. Climbing the ramp you will be required to do an exposed but easy move (big sandstone jug to use) to gain the top of the first bench. Once you are out of the canyon head northeast and you should find an old cattle trail that you can follow towards Baker Canyon. You will skirt around a very small side drainage before intersecting Baker proper. Rim walk north along Baker and enjoy the views. 1 3/4 miles after leaving the river you should find the head of the West Fork of Baker Canyon (N37° 36' 08\" W111° 07' 37\"). Walk into the canyon and you will immediately be stopped by a dryfall, which is bypassed on the east (left) side. Next are several potholes that can be bypassed on the west (right) or tackled head-on for some added fun. Shortly after this you will encounter the first rappel into a pool of water. This is where the routes diverge between West Fork and East Fork. West Fork of Baker Canyon: At the first rappel you will want to put on the wetsuit if you haven't already. The anchor for this rappel is two bolts hidden about 5-feet high. Look for the bolts and you will find them. This rappel is approximately 12-feet depending on water depth. If you test the water depth and it is deep enough this is a fun jump. Continue down canyon and enjoy the narrows. There are four more rappels from double bolt anchors, all less than 30-feet high. After the 5th rappel you will exit a pool on a small ledge where there will be a very tight spot that most will have to climb up 6-feet to squeeze through. Immediately after this is a very large log that can be awkwardly downclimbed; or, drape a rope over it and rappel the few feet for safety. Next, the East Fork of Baker joins from the east (left). It is worth taking a few minutes and exploring up the East Fork until stopped by a dryfall. From the head of the West Fork of Baker to the East/West confluence requires approximately 2 or 3 hours. East Fork of Baker Canyon: From the first rappel in the West Fork of Baker Canyon you must backtrack 100-feet up canyon and locate an escape on the east side of the canyon (N37° 35' 55\" W111° 07' 36\"). Route- find your way out of the canyon bottom and then start traversing the canyon towards a nice viewpoint (N37° 35' 46\" W111° 07' 27\"). From the viewpoint continue rim walking up the East Fork of Baker Canyon until you reach the Entrance (N37° 35' 54\" W111° 07' 15\"). At the Entrance you will be looking at what appears to be a ramp or steep slope (looking up canyon from your rim stance) coming directly towards you. It isn't apparent in this location, but if you hike directly towards this ramp. a ramp on your side will present itself joining with the ramp on the other side that you had seen from the entrance. Climb down the ramp; at the bottom of the ramp you veer right, placing yourself immediately into East Fork proper. The canyon bottom contains a lot of sideways shuffling, swirling narrows, climbing over tight squeezes, and downclimbing. Midway through this section you will encounter a long straight hallway that is vertical, varnished, and featureless that tapers down to being impassible at ground level. Shuffle sideways to where a upward diagonal ledge on your right (west) will allow easier purchase to climb up 20-feet to a point where you can stem sideways down canyon for a short distance over the obstacle. You will notice this canyon makes sudden and frequent changes in direction at fault lines. Soon you will reach another long straight hallway with ledges on both sides of the canyon. The ledges are approximately 2 to 4-feet wide, with a very deep narrow slot between them and soaring walls above. You do not want to go into this slot as it is very narrow and bombays out at the bottom. At the end of the ledge is a single bolt on the left (east) wall in an exposed position. The trick with this rappel is that you must rappel part way down to where you can then slide 10- feet sideways while on rappel, until the canyon opens again and you can rappel to the canyon floor. Be very careful with the rope pull. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/baker.htm 1/25/2018 Baker Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 4 of 4 Below the rappel is a very nice photogenic swirling narrows section. After this is a downclimb too wide to safely reach the bottom. If you look left (east) you will notice a polished scary downward sloping ledge you can traverse for a few feet and then do an intimidating lean to the other side where it is narrow enough to downclimb between two narrow ridges on a sandstone flare/bend. Most parties will want to rappel everyone from a human anchor and then send their best climber down last. A fall here would be bad. Shortly after this obstacle is the canyon crux. The canyon pinches off down low, where only a smurf sized canyoneer can fit - it's less than 9 inches at its widest. Four feet above this pinch, the canyon opens up, allowing one to climb over the pinch. However, on the other side of the pinch the canyon opens up into a wide pothole. It appears you could stem the wide pothole, but given the slick varnished walls, the high penalty points for a fall make this inadvisable. Two options exist for dealing with this obstacle: the first option is to construct a deadman anchor in the pothole above the canyon pinch, which allows for a safe handline or rappel. If the pothole above the pinch is filled with water you need to use option two, which is to rappel everyone safely down using a human anchor, and then send the last (smallest) canyoneer down feet first and allow them to slide and be caught by the other canyoneers. After the canyon crux it is a short jaunt of more downclimbing and squeezing through a dark canyon until the second rappel, which is 30-feet and anchored from a single bolt on the right (west) wall. This rappel deposits you into a wide canyon bottom that is stunning. Shortly after this the West Fork of Baker Canyon joins from the west. From the head of the East Fork of Baker to the East/West confluence requires approximately 2 or 3 hours. Below the West-East Confluence: All together again.... From the confluence of the East and West Fork of Baker Canyon (N37° 35' 40\" W111° 07' 33\"), the canyon opens up shortly and becomes a partial slog. But soon the canyon tightens back up and you are working downclimb after downclimb into pools of water for the next hour until you reach the last rappel. This rappel is 50-feet, partially free hanging, and anchored from two bolts. From the bottom of the last rappel the canyon opens up. Watch out for poison ivy through this next section. Hike downstream until you meet the Escalante River (N37° 35' 06\" W111° 07' 45\"). From here it is only a 4 mile hike upstream to the mouth of Neon Canyon. Alternate Baker Canyon Approach: If approaching from upstream near Fence and Neon Canyon there is a faster approach that eliminates some mileage and bushwhacking along the Escalante River. You simply use the approach to Ringtail Canyon, As you near the entrance to Ringtail canyon merely head east, hiking cross-country, aiming for the West Baker entrance waypoint. Do your best to avoid the cryptobiotic soil.

The canyon remained hidden for years as the neighboring canyons experienced a rush of popularity. But thanks to some enterprising canyoneers with the desire to explore the unknown this canyons enchanting secrets are now unlocked. General Information: Bon Appétit is an amusing slot canyon tucked into a corner of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. The canyon contains many delights for the technical canyoneer. Bon Appétit Canyon requires complete technical gear. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. Summer would be miserable. Bon Appétit is rated 3B VI using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 14 to 18 hours of actual hiking time if doing the complete canyon in one long day. However, this canyon is usually done as part of a combo platter with other canyons in the area. A bivouac along the Escalante River is a popular option for a more enjoyable and shorter day. If using the combo platter option the canyon is rated 3B III and total time required from camp to camp is a more leisurely 8 to 10 hours of actual hiking time. In normal conditions this canyon has the ability to hold a large amount of water and full wetsuits are required. You will encounter several sections of wading and swimming. The route contains several rappels with the longest being 30-feet and requiring 60-feet of rope. Additional gear should consist of 50-feet of webbing, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, several rapid links and a prusik system. Trekking poles for hiking the Escalante River and bushwhacking through the Escalante jungle are tremendously helpful to have along on this adventure. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Egypt\" and \"Scorpion Gulch\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Bon Appétit Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Create Your Own Combo Meal: Bon Appétit Canyon is usually completed in combination with one or more other routes. Top Chef, Neon, Ringtail, Baker and Choprock are all located in the same general vicinity along the Escalante River. The typical combo platter is to backpack down to the Escalante River, set up a base camp, and complete multiple canyons over several days. If the Escalante is running clear you can easily pump water from it. During spring runoff and after large upstream storms the Escalante River water will contain large amounts of silt that will clog your water purification pumps. For this reason having a method of letting the silt settle out of your water before pumping is recommended. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bonappetit.htm 1/25/2018 Bon Appetit Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road and travel 23.7 miles to a turn-off signed \"Early Weed Bench\" on the east (left) side of the road. Follow the Early Weed Bench Road for 4.9 miles to the Early Weed Trailhead. Up to the Early Weed Trailhead the road is well maintained and drivable by passenger vehicles in dry conditions, this road becomes impassible when wet. If you do not have a high clearance vehicle or 4x4 park at the Early Weed Trailhead. For all others continue following the road for another 0.4 miles to a large flat area you can park and camp. This is the Bon Appétit Trailhead. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Route Information: From the Bon Appétit Trailhead (N37° 31' 53\", W111° 11' 37\") hike east to the edge of the bench and route find your way east northeast for 5 1/4 miles staying clear (south) of Twentyfive Mile Wash and all of its tributaries to a break that allows entry to the Escalante River. Navigation across Scorpion Flat to the Escalante River is difficult to describe and it is easiest to follow the map and the waypoints below to route find your way across the landscape. As you hike to your destination it's a good idea to look back at the bench for reference on the hike out. From the edge of the bench, use your GPS to find waypoint (N37° 32' 13\", W111° 10' 55\"). Sighting a feature in the distance and hiking towards it makes things much easier. The next waypoint is (N37° 32' 30\", W111° 09' 43\"). followed by waypoint (N37° 33' 02\", W111° 08' 40\"), then (N37° 33' 18\", W111° 08' 07\"), and (N37° 33' 42\", W111° 07' 46\"). At this point you will start to descend towards the Escalante River hiking on a large sand hill that separates a finger canyon on your right and the Escalante River on the left. Hiking on the right side of the sand hill, navigate towards (N37° 34' 01\", W111° 07' 41\"), and then to (N37° 34' 08\", W111° 07' 31\") where you will be hiking down slickrock into a side canyon. Once in the bottom of the side canyon, hike downstream to a dryfall, which you will bypass on the north (left) and continue route finding down canyon traversing the bench until you can find a reasonable access to the Escalante River. A great place to set up base camp can be found at waypoint (N37° 34' 16\", W111° 07' 34\"). If you can't find this spot, it doesn't matter as there are plenty of areas to set up camp within the vicinity. The approach will take approximately 3 to 4 hours with a loaded backpack. From base camp cross the river and follow the sandstone wall a short distance upstream until it lowers to a level where you can scramble east to the top of the bench (N37° 34' 14\" W111° 07' 44\"). After ascending through the first cliff band hike across the grassy bench in a northeast direction and locate a set of moki steps (N37° 34' 22\" W111° 07' 36\"). The moki steps are difficult to identify from a distance, but seek and you shall find. You must climb up the moki steps for approximately 40-feet. The crux of the climb is located near the top with an estimated rating of 5.5 YDS. From the top of the moki steps continue route finding up to the next level by hiking across the slickrock. Upon reaching the next level hike for 1 1/4 miles in a northeast direction to the head of a small canyon (N37° 34' 55\" W111° 06' 52\"). Cross the small canyon and ascend to a small pass (N37° 35' 00\" W111° 06' 41\"). From the small pass the head of Top Chef is seen below at (N37° 34' 58\" W111° 06' 33\"). Cross the head of Top Chef and hike south, bench walking back to the Escalante River (N37° 34' 29\" W111° 06' 34\"). Next hike east until you are around the sandstone walls that guard the drainage to the east. Hike back north and cross the first drainage (N37° 34' 35\" W111° 06' 18\"), which doesn't look like much, but the pour over is very impressive. Continue bench walking east until you reach the head of Bon Appétit ((N37° 34' 43\", W111° 06' 00\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bonappetit.htm 1/25/2018 Bon Appetit Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 Route find your way down the slickrock to the canyon bottom which should take approximately 2 to 3 hours from camp depending on your route finding skills. Explore up canyon though a slot section to where the canyon forks. You can explore up both forks and then return to where you entered Bon Appétit. This is where the real fun begins. Hike downstream until encounter some PG stemming and a downclimb through a fluted double natural bridge. A partner assist will help you overcome this obstacle. After this there is some easy hiking until you encounter a keeper pothole that can be walked around on the east (left) side. This is followed by a tight section of water filled narrows. You can climb over the tight sections of this slot. Next up is an open area followed by a second section of tight narrows that widens towards the end. You might encounter water in this section. Then the canyon opens up with some downclimbing until the first rappel, which is 30-feet into a pool of water. Continue hiking downstream until you reach an elevator that you need to climb out to the edge of it to slide down to the next level. At the top of the elevator you will need to rig the second rappel from one of two chokestones before sliding the vertical elevator to the next level. From here rappel to the next level. From the chokestone anchor to the bottom of the rappel is 30- feet. The canyon opens up after this and you will soon encounter the final pothole section with one keeper that is walked around on the east (left) side. Next you will encounter a downclimb and a final large pothole that you can route find your way around on the east (left) side. At this point you will be on a bench and you will need to route find approximately 200-yards to the east and locate a loose break that you can downclimb through to the next level. Traverse back west to Bon Appétit and cross the drainage. At this point it is not obvious how to get to the next level, however just after crossing Bon Appétit walk down canyon for 50-feet and locate a hidden hallway that takes you down to the next level where you can then navigate the boulder field to the end. Occasionally the hidden hallway will be cairned. Navigating the canyon will take between 3 to 4 hours. Follow the Escalante River upstream and back to your base camp which will take approximately 2 hours depending on your trail finding skills through the Escalante Jungle. At times, the trail is obvious, but during river crossings, losing the trail and bushwhacking will be part of the adventure.

The length of required sustained exertion is long, exhausting, wet and challenging. Climbing and swimming are the name of the game. This is not a place for anyone but advanced canyoneers. The canyon earned it's skull and cross bones in April, 2005 when two BYU students perished in the canyon. Choprock Canyon is one of the most difficult canyons in the area. Warning: Every member of your group must be a skilled canyoneer. All people in your party must be an athlete in good condition. If you do not meet these recommendations stay out of this canyon, you will not have fun. Choprock Canyon could be deadly for beginners, even with advanced leadership. The following description is not a substitute for common sense and experience. Do not underestimate the difficulty of descending this canyon. Canyoneers have died in this canyon, it can be lethal. At least one canyoneer has described the \"freak out\" potential as high. A rescue in this canyon would be dangerous and extremely complex. This canyon has a high flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The South Fork of Choprock Canyon is rated 4B R V using the Canyon Rating System. General Information: If you enjoy swimming, downclimbing, narrows, rappelling, long days and expedition type canyons this might be for you. The canyon is extremely exhausting both mentally and physically. Choprock Canyon requires complete technical gear. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. The route contains several rappels with the longest being 70-feet. A 50 meter rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. The lighter and smaller the pack the better. I recommend a 20 to 30-foot piece of webbing for each party member as it helps with stemming high and leaving your pack float until you can pull it up to you. In normal conditions this canyon holds a large amount of water. Several sections of swimming and long sections of wading are required. Full wetsuits are required, shorty style and summer weight wetsuits are not acceptable. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 14 to 18 hours. An overnight campsite at the confluence of Fence Canyon and the Escalante River is the standard approach for canyoneers completing this route. An overnight campsite allows an early start to what will probably be a very long day. Total time from camp to camp at the mouth of Fence Canyon will be approximately 10 to 14 hours. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/chop.htm 1/25/2018 Choprock Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 A GPS is very useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Egypt\", \"Silver Falls Bench\" and \"Horse Pasture Mesa\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate with a GPS and more difficult without. There are few prominent landmarks to assist with topographical navigation. Consider map reading skills a prerequisite for this canyon. All waypoints and maps for Choprock Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Create Your Own Meal: Choprock is often completed in combination with one or more other routes. Neon, Ringtail, Baker, Top Chef and Choprock are all accessed from the bottom of Fence Canyon on the Escalante River. The typical combo platter is to backpack down to the Escalante River and set up a base camp somewhere along the river between Fence Canyon and Neon Canyon. There is good camping at the mouth of Neon. One of the best spots shaded by a tree is almost always taken. You can hike up Neon for a short distance and find several good campsites. The area around Fence Canyon was blown out with a massive flood in 2006 and has lots of campsites, but not always shaded from the sun. You will pass several nice campsites between Fence and Neon. Additionally there are campsites below Neon on both sides of the river. You have several options for obtaining water in the area. If the Escalante is running clear you can pump water from it. During spring runoff and after large upstream storms the Escalante is very silty and not really pumpable. If that is the case you can usually locate clean water at the mouth of Fence Canyon or by hiking 10 minutes up Neon to a seep/spring. You will be dodging poison ivy to get at the source of the cleanest water. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road and travel 16.5 miles to a turn-off signed \"Egypt\" on the east (left) side of the road. Follow the Egypt Road for 9.5 miles to a fork in the road. Take the east (right) fork and drive 0.5 miles to the Egypt Trailhead. There is reasonable primitive camping along the last 2 miles of the Egypt Road. The trailhead is accessible to all high clearance 2wd vehicles in normal weather conditions. Route Information: From the Egypt Trailhead (N37° 35' 35\", W111° 13' 07\") follow the cairned route northeast as it descends to a wash that forms Fence Canyon. Follow the north edge of the wash as the canyon deepens. Eventually the North Fork of Fence Canyon joins and forces you to descend the trail into Fence Canyon. Hike down Fence Canyon to its confluence with the Escalante River (N37° 36' 44\", W111° 10' 44\"). When doing this route I suggest you set up camp here (or nearby) to allow an early start in the morning. The spot is a popular place to camp and the cottonwood trees make for a nice campsite. It is 3 miles from the Egypt Trailhead to the Escalante River, it requires about 2 hours to hike down to the river and 2 1/2 hours to hike back up to the trailhead. From the mouth of Fence Canyon you must make your way, northeast, across the Escalante River, and up a weakness in the canyon wall to a bench. Hike north along the bench a short distance and than exit to the top of Choprock Bench through a small unnamed canyon. From the mouth of Fence Canyon you must hike northeast approximately 4 miles to a spot above Choprock Canyon and below a mesa (N37° 39' 03\", W111° 08' 09\"). Navigation with a GPS is moderate, without a GPS you will certainly test your orientation skills. At this point you need to work your way down to the bench above Choprock Canyon and than contour the canyon east for 3/4 mile until you can reach the bottom of the South Fork of Chop Rock Canyon (N37° 39' 07\", W111° 07' 27\"). Reaching the floor of the canyon from the rim is a little challenging but nothing to difficult. A walk down entrance are the benefits of good route finding skills. From Fence Canyon to the entrance of Choprock will required 3 to 4 hours. Choprock divides up nicely into three distinct sections of canyon commonly known as the \"Riparian Ballroom\", \"Happy Section\" and \"Grim Section\". You should currently be standing at http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/chop.htm 1/25/2018 Choprock Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 the top of the section known as the Riparian Ballroom, you are also probably standing in poison ivy. This section of canyon is filled with it so beware. Experience and problem solving skills are essential. The route is not always obvious. Riparian Ballroom: Good stuff, you might feel as if you are in a jungle at times. Walk down the watercourse through waist to chest deep water, perhaps several short swims. At times you will be surrounded by vegetation growing over the banks as you break through spider web after spider web. The section contains big trees and easy downclimbing. You will encounter one mandatory rappel of 50 feet, anchored from a large chokestone into a large pool. The Riparian Ballroom should last 1 to 2 hours. Happy Section: Better stuff, this is a subway type section that contains flowing water. Some hiking, some downclimbing and a little swimming are required. One 20-foot rappel anchored from a single bolt is required. The Happy Section should last 1 to 2 hours. Grim Section: Best stuff, this section contains downclimbing, wading, swimming, climbing under/over logjams, swimming through log soup, stemming, chimneying, and a 100- yard swim through the guts of the earth. This section is relentless. Every time the slot appears about to open up there is another downclimb through a narrow crack that ends in a water filled pothole, exit and repeat. You must often downclimb to find a hidden tunnel under a log or out the bottom of the corkscrew. The final rappel is 70-feet and anchored by three bolts. The Grim Section should last 3 to 4 hours From the bottom of the final rappel hike down canyon. Soon the Main Fork of Choprock (N37° 38' 07\", W111° 10' 23\") joins from the north (right). Continue down canyon anther 3/4 mile to the confluence of Choprock and the Escalante River (N37° 37' 35\", W111° 10' 54\"). Just before the confluence there is a petroglyph panel on the north (right) canyon wall. From the mouth of Choprock head downstream 1 mile to your campsite at the mouth of Fence Canyon.

The route consists of a sweet upper canyon with two sections of slot and a lush lower canyon with large alcoves and Bement Arch. This is a great canyon for those entering the realm of technical canyoneering to gain some experience. Davis Gulch is also the notorious centerpiece of the Everett Ruess legend. General Information: Davis Gulch is a great slot canyon that requires complete technical gear. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. Davis Gulch is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. The route is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. The route can be downclimbed by the highly skilled but everyone else will require a couple short rappels or handlines. Better safe then sorry, always remember, its a long ways to mediocre medical care. A 50-foot rope is required along with 50-feet of webbing to rig required rappels or handlines. Davis Gulch has the ability to hold a large amount of water. Wetsuits are advised as you will encounter several sections of wading and possible swimming. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 8 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Davis Gulch\" is essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Davis Gulch use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Everett Ruess: Everett Ruess is a local legend; a young idealistic artist who fell in love with the redrock canyon country and began wandering ever deeper into the labyrinths of canyons. In October 1934, at the age of 20, Ruess set out from the town of Escalante and headed down Davis Gulch and disappeared into history. He was never heard from again. His work is immortalized in his journals, letters and art which he left behind. Many have speculated about what happened to Ruess and his disappearance is a local mystery. Some suspect he fell from a cliff, or drowned in a flashflood, perhaps he became stranded in a slot canyon, others think he was murdered. In any case, his statements on life and adventure, combined with his isolation and early death, have led to a kind of legendary status. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road and travel 51.8 miles to a parking area on the south (right) side of the road. This is the Davis Gulch Trailhead. You will know you are in the right correct place if you pass a fence and cattle guard approximately 0.2 miles prior to the trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all high clearance 2wd vehicles in normal weather conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. There is reasonable camping near the trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/davis.htm 1/25/2018 Davis Gulch - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 Route Information: From the Davis Gulch Trailhead (N37° 15' 08\", W110° 58' 26\") look Southwest and locate Hole-In-The Rock Arch (N37° 14' 41\", W110° 59' 07\") high on the cliff above. This is an important landmark that will make your return to the trailhead easier if you locate it now. From the trailhead hike north across Hole-In-The-Rock Road and into the canyon. After a few minutes of hiking you will begin downclimbing and entering the first section of narrows. The first section of narrows contains several downclimbing problems and possibly one rappel depending on your skills. The first section of narrows is short and the canyon will soon open up to the full sun and an escape route for those who think they might have bitten off more then they can chew. You can use this first section to help judge how much water you might encounter latter on. If you encounter a couple of pools of waist deep water in the first section be prepared for the canyon to be filled with water and wetsuits are advised for the second section of narrows. The second section of narrows is awesome. The second section contains downclimbs, short swims, wading through long hallways, a subway and 2 or 3 rappels depending on ability. All too soon the canyon suddenly opens up. Find a place to change out of your wetsuit and enjoy the long hike down a sandy wash that soon turns to flowing water with cottonwoods and lush vegetation. In the lower section of canyon you will discover several very large alcoves as the river meanders through the heart of Escalante. At roughly the midway point of your trip down Davis Gulch you will encounter Bement Arch (N37° 17' 03\", W110° 57' 54\") on the north side of the canyon. The best way to photograph this large arch is from up canyon. Toward the bottom of the canyon you can avoid the brush by staying on hiker trails that cross the river. Eventually you will encounter the remains of an old fence against the north canyon wall (N37° 18' 01\" W110° 57' 03\"). This is the exit point. From the exit point follow the well cairned cattle trail up the north side of the canyon as it traverses up and over steep slickrock. After reaching the top of the steep slickrock locate Hole- In-The Rock Arch and head towards it. Heading away from Davis Gulch in an arc will allow you to stay away from small drainage's and make the return hike much easier. From the top of the slick rock it is approximately 3 1/2 miles of hiking in the hot sun until you intersect the Hole-In- The Rock Road (N37° 15' 26\" W110° 59' 07\"). After intersecting the road follow it east for 1 mile back to the Davis Gulch Trailhead.

If you enjoy problem solving this might be the canyon you are looking for. General Information: Headless Hen is rated 4B R III using the Canyon Rating System. Headless Hen requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 5 to 6 hours. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. This canyon contains multiple keeper potholes. Bring your full arsenal of pothole escape gear (the route contains no hooking). At least four throw bags (Pot Shots) are recommended for this route, you will find them invaluable in this canyon. Skilled teamwork is required to escape many of these potholes. Staging partners and planning your way down canyon is essential. A least one person in your party should be an expert in pothole escape techniques. A minimum party size of 4 is required. Wetsuits are required in all but the warmest conditions. The canyon contains no required rappels, but two 70-foot ropes are suggested for pothole escape, problem solving, handlines and emergencies. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system. Anchors required for negotiating the potholes are scarce in this canyon. You might need to rappel/handline from packs or potshots placed near the lip of a pothole and pull them over from down canyon with a retrieval line. A GPS is very useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"King Mesa\" is essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Headless Hen use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road and travel 33.0 miles to a turn-off signed \"Chimney Rock\" on the east (left) side of the road (N37° 23' 35\" W111° 08' 36\"). Follow the Chimney Rock road for 3.0 miles to Chimney Rock. Chimney Rock is the trailhead for Headless Hen and Raven Canyon. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. There are several nice primitive camp spots along the final section of road. The trailhead is accessible to carefully driven passenger vehicles in normal weather conditions. During periods of stormy weather the Hole-In- The-Rock Road has been known to wash out in sections. When the road is washed out a 4x4 is required. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/headlesshen.htm 1/25/2018 Headless Hen - Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 Route Information: From Chimney Rock (N37° 24' 44\" W111° 06' 27\") hike due north until you intersect a side drainage. Route find your way down the side drainage until you intersect Coyote Gulch (N37° 25' 39\" W111° 06' 17\"). Hike down Coyote gulch following use trails. Bypass a short flowing water slot section of Coyote Gulch. Continue hiking downstream a short distance until you reach the confluence of Raven Canyon and Headless Hen (N37° 25' 44\" W111° 06' 06\") entering from the north (left). The confluence is not obvious. Hike upstream in Raven/Headless Hen for a short distance to where you will see Raven Canyon on your right start to develop. Route find your way north, up the hill between Raven and Headless Hen to a large cottonwood tree (N37° 26' 28\" W111° 05' 59\") that resembles a large bush with many smaller trunks shooting out of it. On your approach you will notice a rock formation that looks like a headless hen or dove for which the route is named. Once you reach the cottonwood tree its all downstream. The canyon has pothole after pothole. In the first part of the canyon most of the potholes can be bypassed, but soon the canyon takes shape and you must negotiate through the potholes. If the canyon is completely full of water, it will be an easy romp. If the canyon is empty or only partially full of water you will have to use all your pothole escape experience and team skills. At the end of the canyon there is an optional rappel that can be walked around on the west (right). After completing the pothole hike back down to Coyote Gulch. Combo Meal: It is recommended that you combine both Raven Canyon and Headless Hen into an all day adventure. If completing the combo meal it is suggested that you begin with Raven. You will want to stash extra food, water and required gear at the confluence of Raven and Headless Hen to avoid the having to carry a large load through the canyons. Completing both canyons will require about 7 to 8 hours.

Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 1 of 4 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Neon Canyon Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument Technical Canyoneering Neon Canyon is one of the most popular canyons in the area. Hikers come to enjoy the beauty of the Golden Cathedral. Technical canyoneers come to test their skills, and show off for the hikers who come to visit the Golden Cathedral. Some of the photographs used on this page are compliments of Giles Wallace and Bruce Neumann. General Information: If you enjoy swimming, downclimbing, narrows, rappelling and a long day this might be the route for you. Neon Canyon requires complete technical gear. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. The route contains several rappels with the biggest being 80-feet. A 50 meter rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 80 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. In normal conditions this canyon holds a large amount of water. Several sections of swimming and long sections of wading are required. Full wetsuits are required in spring and fall with shorties being acceptable during the hot summer months. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 10 to 12 hours of actual hiking time. A bivouac at the junction of Fence Canyon and the Escalante River is a popular option for a more enjoyable and shorter day. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Egypt\" is essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Neon Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Neon Canyon is rated 3B R IV using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Please do not place bolts in this canyon. Neon has often been at the center of the so called \"Bolt War\", where bolts are repeatedly placed and chopped. This canyon is easy to descend using only natural features. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without using or placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which is considered part of the adventure and charm of canyoneering. Warning: In the past the route has a large keeper pothole that appears and disappears at the whim of the last flash flood. It was/is located just upstream from the Cathedral Rappel. Go prepared to escape this obstacle or reverse course. Do not attempt to solo this route. This pothole has been known to stop experienced and talented canyoneering teams when in its most difficult and dangerous condition. You have been warned! The Neon Keeper Pothole A brief history of the large keeper pothole just before the cathedral rappel might prove useful. Under certain conditions the large keeper pothole in Neon is famous for being a formidable obstacle. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/neon.htm 1/25/2018 Neon Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 Prior to 2001 the Neon keeper pothole was hidden underneath a flat gravel bar. No matter the water conditions, there was no indication of the pothole that lurked beneath. The gravel in the pothole was golf ball-sized, perhaps minimizing the chance of it being cleared away. The pothole remained hidden until sometime during the winter of 2001-2002 when a flash flood scoured the pothole clean. This newly revealed pothole soon proved to be a formidable obstacle; sometimes making escape extremely difficult depending on the conditions. Since that time the newly cleared pothole has existed in one of three modes depending on the depth of the water: Swimmer Mode: Where one can simply swim out of the far side of the pothole. Regular Mode: Where one can stand on the bottom of the pothole and still have one’s head above water. Keeper Mode: Where one can neither stand on the bottom nor swim out. So, what are the odds of finding it in keeper mode? It is difficult to precisely estimate because the conditions are always changing. Evaporation combined with absorption of water into the sandstone can change the conditions from swimmer mode, to keeper mode and beyond to regular mode in a matter of weeks. The process might be shortened to just a few days in warmer weather. If your group can’t defeat the pothole you will be forced to retreat . There is a set of Moki steps on the northwest (right) canyon wall that can be taken up to the rim and back to the approach trail. The first few Moki steps are gone, but with a partner assist the rest are reachable. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road and travel 16.5 miles to a turn-off signed \"Egypt\" on the east (left) side of the road. Follow the Egypt Road for 9.5 miles to a fork in the road. Take the east (right) fork and drive 0.5 miles to the Egypt Trailhead. There is reasonable primitive camping along the last 2 miles of the Egypt Road. The trailhead is accessible to all high clearance 2wd vehicles in normal weather conditions. Route Information: From the Egypt Trailhead (N37° 35' 35\", W111° 13' 07\") follow the cairned route northeast as it descends to a wash that forms Fence Canyon. Follow the north edge of the wash, as the canyon deepens, until the North Fork of Fence Canyon joins and forces you to descend the trail into Fence Canyon. Hike down Fence Canyon to its confluence with the Escalante River (N37° 36' 44\", W111° 10' 44\"). It is 3 miles from the Egypt Trailhead to the Escalante River. From the mouth of Fence Canyon hike downstream 1 mile to the mouth of Neon Canyon (N37° 36' 23\", W111° 10' 05\") entering from the east (left). It requires about 2 1/2 hours to hike down to the mouth of Neon Canyon and 3 hours to hike back up to the trailhead. Near the mouth of Neon Canyon is a popular place to camp for those using more than one day to complete the route. From the mouth of Neon Canyon hike 300 yards up Neon to a point that allows access out to the north (left) rim of the canyon (N37° 36' 30\", W111° 10' 04\"). Use the access to escape from the canyon bottom and hike up to a wide bench with a well defined trail. Follow the trail east as it contours above Neon Canyon. The route description provided is the \"full meal deal\", it is possible to short-cut the route, skip most the canyon, and just do the Golden Cathedral rappel. But my feeling is why pay for the honeymoon and then sleep in separate beds? http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/neon.htm 1/25/2018 Neon Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 Hike along the bench for 1 1/2 miles until you encounter a good size drainage entering the main fork of Neon Canyon (N37° 37' 19\", W111° 09' 22\"). This is a good place to route find your way to the bottom of Neon Canyon. The canyon is a walk in if you possess good route finding skills. Once you reach the bottom of the canyon its time to let the honeymoon begin. This first section of canyon usually contains long sections of wading and swimming. The canyon will open up before pinching back down and dropping you into a dark slot leading to a keeper pothole. This obstacle is usually defeated with a partner assist if attacking head on or by climbing to a bolt on the east (left) side and rappelling 25-feet to the canyon bottom on the downstream side of the pothole. Continue down canyon and enjoy downclimbing, potholes, swimming, wading, rappelling and repeat. Just before the canyon ends at its signature feature known as the \"Golden Cathedral\" you might encounter a second keeper pothole. Over the last several years this pothole has been presenting different problems after every major storm. Sometimes its easy and sometimes its more difficult. Be prepared for changing conditions with several different plans of attack for escaping this pothole if required. The canyon ends at the Golden Cathedral. This feature consists of a triple pothole arch that you rappel through into a pool of water. The rappel is 80-feet and anchored from a large chokestone. If the webbing is old or worn it will require 40-feet of new webbing to correctly rig and replace the anchor. After completing the final rappel it's time to pack up your gear and head back to the Egypt Trailhead. Create Your Own Meal: Neon Canyon is often completed in combination with one or more other routes. Neon, Ringtail, Baker, Top Chef and Choprock are all accessed from the bottom of Fence Canyon on the Escalante River. The typical combo platter is to backpack down to the Escalante River and set up a base camp somewhere along the river between Fence Canyon and Neon Canyon. There is good camping at the mouth of Neon. One of the best spots shaded by a tree is almost always taken. You can hike up Neon for a short distance and find several good campsites. The area around Fence Canyon was blown out with a massive flood in 2006 and has lots of campsites, but not always shaded from the sun. You will pass several nice campsites between Fence and Neon. Additionally there are campsites below Neon on both sides of the river. You have several options for obtaining water in the area. If the Escalante is running clear you can pump water from it. During spring runoff and after large upstream storms the Escalante is very silty and not really pumpable. If that is the case you can usually locate clean water at the mouth of Fence Canyon or by hiking 10 minutes up Neon to a seep/spring. You will be dodging poison ivy to get at the source of the cleanest water. Videos: Neon Canyon - The video is compliments of David Smith. Neon Canyon - The video is compliments of Blake Merrell. Hiking and Backpacking Information: The Golden Cathedral is a popular backpacking, hiking and photographic destination. The route is the same as the technical route except once you turn into Neon canyon just hike up stream to the Golden Cathedral. Camping at or near the actual Golden Cathedral is considered poor form because it degrades the experience of others.

Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Raven Canyon AKA: Foxhole Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument Technical Canyoneering Raven Canyon is a great warm up to begin any trip in the King Mesa region. Many of the canyons in this area require stemming. What is Stemming you ask? It's suspending yourself between the canyon walls to make passage downstream because the canyon bottom is too narrow for your body to fit through. This canyon starts out pretty mellow and has you wondering why you are even there, but then it will surprise you. General Information: Raven Canyon is rated 3B R III using the Canyon Rating System. Every member of your group must have reasonable climbing skills. If you do not meet these recommendations stay out of this canyon. Raven requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 4 to 5 hours. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. Wetsuits are only required in cold or wet conditions. Many of the wet problems can be climbed around. The route contains no required rappels, but a 50-feet rope is suggest to be used as a handline and to work with throw bags. This route requires complete pothole escape gear. At least two throw bags (Pot Shots) are recommended for this route as the timid may not be comfortable stemming over some of the potholes. Other required gear should consist of a mae west bunny strap, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system. A GPS is very useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"King Mesa\" is essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Raven use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road and travel 33.0 miles to a turn-off signed \"Chimney Rock\" on the east (left) side of the road (N37° 23' 35\" W111° 08' 36\"). Follow the Chimney Rock road for 3.0 miles to Chimney Rock. Chimney Rock is the trailhead for Raven Canyon and Headless Hen. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. There are several nice primitive camp spots along the final section of road. The trailhead is accessible to carefully driven passenger vehicles in normal weather conditions. During periods of stormy weather the Hole-In- The-Rock Road has been known to wash out in sections. When the road is washed out a 4x4 is required. Route Information: From Chimney Rock (N37° 24' 44\" W111° 06' 27\") hike due north until you intersect a side drainage. Route find your way down the side drainage until you intersect Coyote Gulch (N37° 25' 39\" W111° 06' 17\"). Hike down Coyote gulch following use trails. Bypass a short flowing water slot section of Coyote Gulch. Continue hiking downstream a short distance until http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/raven.htm 1/25/2018 Raven Canyon - Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 you reach the confluence of Raven Canyon and Headless Hen (N37° 25' 44\" W111° 06' 06\") entering from the north (left). The confluence is not obvious. Hike upstream in Raven/Headless Hen for a short distance to where you will see Raven Canyon on your right start to develop. Route find your way north, up the hill between Raven and Headless Hen, until you find and open slickrock bowl to your east (right). A steep hike will place you at the head of the slot (N37° 26' 19\" W111° 05' 38\"). Head downstream and let the fun and games begin. The first part of the canyon is pretty mellow with easy stemming and sections easily avoidable by rim walking on the north (right) side. Just when you are starting to get bored, the canyon slots up. Immediately you will encounter a section requiring stemming to get up over a pinch. A first it appears as if you can traverse west (right) and make your way to a chokestone at the top of the pinch, but the traverse comes with major penalty points for failure. It is better to downclimb and then chimney your way back up. From the top of the pinch continue downstream while stemming, soon the canyon will open up where you can walk on the canyon floor. Next you will encounter a miniature subway section through a layer of sandstone with black horizontal layers. The sharp black layers stick out at the level where you will be route find your way through the wide part while heal-toeing and stemming. Next you will encounter some keeper potholes than can be climbed around, stemmed over or engineered through. After the potholes continue down canyon and back to the junction with Headless Hen. Combo Meal: It is recommended that you combine both Raven Canyon and Headless Hen into an all day adventure. If completing the combo meal it is suggested that you begin with Raven. You will want to stash extra food, water and required gear at the confluence of Raven and Headless Hen to avoid carrying a large load through the canyons. Completing both canyons will require about 7 to 8 hours.

This is without doubt the best slot canyon in the Red Breaks drainage. This is a great canyon for those with good backcountry skills that do not want a technical challenge. General Information: There are several slot canyon routes in the Red Breaks area, many of them requiring miles of tedious hiking in very soft sand. The Big West Fork of Red Breaks is the best slot canyon of them all and this route describes how to access it in the easiest way possible. The Big West Fork of Red Breaks requires no technical gear and is accessible to all experienced and physically fit hikers. The route described is rated 2AII using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon should be dry unless it has rained recently. A 30-foot rope or webbing is recommended for handlines, emergencies and shuttling backpacks as required. There are approximately a dozen downclimbs in this slot, all of which can be easily defeated with a little teamwork. Total round trip time required to visit this canyon is approximately 4 to 5 hours. A GPS is helpful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Red Breaks\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use WGS84 datum. Navigation for this route is moderate. There is no hiker trail for this route, but mistakes in navigation are easy to overcome and correct on this route. This canyon has moderate flashflood danger, a clear view of any approaching weather is easily visible before committing to this slot canyon. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 10.6 miles east on Highway 12 to the unsigned Spencer Flat Road (N37° 44' 34\", W111° 26' 54\"). Spencer Flat Road is located at mile marker 70.0 on Highway 12. The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right if coming from Escalante) on the Spencer Flat Road and travel 5.8 miles, where you will come to a split in the road (N37° 42' 47\", W111° 22' 24\"). There will be a sign at the road junction that says \"Horse and foot traffic welcome.\" At this junction, the main, better maintained Spencer Flat Road makes a hard right (to the south). Take this road and follow it for 1.6 miles to a fork in the road (N37° 41' 36\", W111° 22' 43\"), take the south (left) fork and follow the road an addition 1.0 miles to the Red Breaks Trailhead. The trailhead is usually accessible to carefully driven passenger cars in normal weather conditions. However, after heavy rains, there may be some wash crossings that require high clearance or 4wd vehicles. Please check the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument roads report for the latest conditions on Spencer Flat Road. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/redbreaks.htm 1/25/2018 Red Breaks Big West Fork - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. There is reasonable primitive camping off of the Spencer Flat Road on your way into the trailhead. Route Information: From the Red Breaks Big West Fork Trailhead (N37° 40' 48\", W111° 22' 26\") hike southeast for 1/2 mile along the slickrock towards the base of the cliff in front of you. You will gradually go around an outcropping of sandstone. Don't start climbing up the cliff until you have hiked completely around the outcropping. Begin your ascent up the cliff (N37° 40' 39\", W111° 21' 57\") towards a weakness at the top (N37° 40' 48\", W111° 21' 57\"). There are several choices to reach this weakness and all of them are very easy. If you find yourself doing exposed or difficult climbing then you are in the wrong spot. Remember your ascent route through the cliff band because this will also be your return route on the way down. Once at the top of the cliff hike 1 mile northeast toward the top of the Big West Fork of Red Breaks Canyon. You will cross several minor drainages along the way. Be careful to avoid trampling plants and crypto while crossing this section of desert. Soon you will arrive at a ridge where you can easily see into your intended canyon (N37° 41' 15\", W111° 21' 11\"). Scramble down the gentle slope to the floor of the canyon. Your hiking time should be approximately one hour to this point. The first section of canyon is entertaining and contains a couple of dryfalls which can easily be bypassed on the sides. After about 30 minutes you will arrive at a dark and sinister looking slot that is appears very narrows. Large frame canyoneers (those over 200 pounds) will likely have to work a little harder to get through this spot. The tight section is only about 50-feet in length and you can climb up and over any constrictions, no one should ever get stuck. Downclimb into the slot and enjoy the spectacular scenery. You will encounter about a dozen downclimbs, all easily defeated with a little teamwork. The crux downclimb is toward the bottom of the canyon and is 15-feet tall. It is defeated by downclimbing some steps on the east (left) side. A handline from above will greatly benefit those that lack climbing skills. Soon the canyon will open up and you will arrive at a 30-foot dryfall (N37° 40' 03\", W111° 20' 34\"), which marks the end of the Big West Fork. Hike out of the slot and up the ridge to the west. Hike 1 3/4 miles across the desert towards the weakness at the top of the cliff band that you climbed earlier in the day. Once at the top of the weakness retrace your route from earlier in the day back to the trailhead. The return trip from the 30-foot dryfall back to the trailhead will require approximately 1 1/2 hours. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

But the canyon poses a dilemma in that it is a rather short canyon with a long approach. However this shortcoming is often used to an advantage by those using the canyon as a rest day while attempting some of the heavy hitters in the same region. General Information: Ringtail is a marvelous but short slot canyon tucked into the heart of some of the finest canyon country on the planet. The canyon is packed full of fun for the technical canyoneer. Ringtail Canyon requires complete technical gear. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. The route can be downclimbed by the skilled with the possibility of a couple short rappels or handlines. A 60-foot rope is required, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. In normal conditions this canyon holds a large amount of water and full wetsuits are required. You will encounter several sections of swimming and wading. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 9 to 10 hours of actual hiking time. A bivouac near the mouth of Neon Canyon and the Escalante River is a popular option for a more enjoyable and shorter day. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Egypt\" is essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Ringtail Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Warning: Ringtail is rated 3B R IV using the Canyon Rating System. Large frame canyoneers will have a difficult time descending Ringtail Canyon as it contains several squeezing obstacles. Most of the squeeze obstacles can be defeated by climbing up and over them. Bring as small of pack as possible. You have been warned! Create Your Own Meal: Ringtail Canyon is usually completed in combination with one or more other routes. Neon, Ringtail, Baker, Top Chef and Choprock are all accessed from the bottom of Fence Canyon on the Escalante River. The typical combo platter is to backpack down to the Escalante River and set up a base camp somewhere along the river between Fence Canyon and Neon Canyon. There is good camping at the mouth of Neon. One of the best spots shaded by a tree is almost always taken. You can hike up Neon for a short distance and find several good campsites. The area around Fence Canyon was blown out with a massive flood in 2006 and has lots of campsites, but not always shaded from the sun. You will pass several nice campsites between Fence and Neon. Additionally there are campsites below Neon on both sides of the river. You have several options for obtaining water in the area. If the Escalante is running clear you can pump water from it. During spring runoff and after large upstream storms the Escalante is very silty and not really pumpable. If that is the case you can usually locate clean water at the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/ringtail.htm 1/25/2018 Ringtail Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 mouth of Fence Canyon or by hiking 10 minutes up Neon to a seep/spring. You will be dodging poison ivy to get at the source of the cleanest water. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road and travel 16.5 miles to a turn-off signed \"Egypt\" on the east (left) side of the road. Follow the Egypt Road for 9.5 miles to a fork in the road. Take the east (right) fork and drive 0.5 miles to the Egypt Trailhead. There is reasonable primitive camping along the last 2 miles of the Egypt Road. The trailhead is accessible to all high clearance 2wd vehicles in normal weather conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Route Information: From the Egypt Trailhead (N37° 35' 35\", W111° 13' 07\") follow the cairned route northeast as it descends to a wash that forms Fence Canyon. Follow the north edge of the wash, as the canyon deepens, until the North Fork of Fence Canyon joins and forces you to descend the trail into Fence Canyon. Hike down Fence Canyon to its confluence with the Escalante River (N37° 36' 44\", W111° 10' 44\"). It is 3 miles from the Egypt Trailhead to the Escalante River. From the mouth of Fence Canyon hike downstream 1 mile to the mouth of Neon Canyon (N37° 36' 23\", W111° 10' 05\") entering from the east (left). It requires about 2 1/2 hours to hike down to the mouth of Neon Canyon and 3 hours to hike back up to the trailhead. Near the mouth of Neon Canyon is a popular place to camp for those using more than one day to complete the route. From the mouth of Neon Canyon hike down the Escalante River for 1 mile and you will see a small side canyon known as Ringtail Canyon (N37° 35' 59\", W111° 09' 25\") entering from the east (left). Just downstream from the mouth of Ringtail Canyon look for a slickrock ascent from the canyon floor. Hike up the steep slickrock route finding the easiest way to the top. Once on top rim walk the east side of the canyon until you reach an easy scramble down to the head of Ringtail Canyon (N37° 36' 27\" W111° 08' 46\"). Head down canyon and let the fun begin. First you will encounter several obstacles that can be skirted around or climbed over. You might encounter wading in this upper section. The canyon is well lit, open and narrow at the same time. Next up are a couple of tighter sections with water and a difficult downclimb that has no rappel anchor into a pool of water. Several options exist for defeating this obstacle. You can do a full body stem over the pool with a very wide and exposed downclimb on the other side. Or rappel your first person down using a human anchor and have them spot and provide a partner assist from below. The canyons character changes as the narrows develop deeper and deeper. Soon you encounter a squeeze under a logjam that almost looks down climbable into a pool of water, but you will want to rappel off of the logjam to check the depth of the pool before splashing in. This is the first of two keeper potholes. If in keeper mode you can climb above the logjam before entering the pothole and toss a pack over the far lip of the pothole. The lip can have slippery mud caked on it and the sandstone is downward sloping. The first keeper pothole is also identified by some shallow Moki Steps on the east (left). The Moki Steps could be used to climb up the canyon but the steps are shallow, exposed and not recommended. Once out of the first keeper pothole you will downclimb and peek around another corner to find another slippery downclimb into the second keeper pothole. A pack toss will defeat this pothole and can be thrown by climbing up on a ledge to the west (right) above the corner before the slippery downclimb. A partner assist might be all that is required to exit the second keeper pothole, but if the pothole has been scoured out a pack toss from above will be necessary. The two keeper potholes are ever changing, the second keeper pothole did not appear until the big floods of 2006. The potholes are also the usual barrier stopping hikers from below. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/ringtail.htm 1/25/2018 Ringtail Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 After the keeper potholes the canyon becomes less technical with downclimbs and sideways squeezing in the dark being the name of the game. Soon the canyon opens to the light of day where there are some nice boulders to peel off your wetsuit before you hike back towards Neon Canyon.

The canyon requires sustained high stemming, chimneying and challenging climbing. Sleepy Hollow is one of the the most difficult canyons on the Colorado Plateau. For those with the skill to tackle this beast it is a canyon classic. Warning: Every member of your group must be a skilled canyoneer in excellent physical condition. If you do not meet these recommendations stay out of this canyon. Sleepy Hollow could be deadly for beginners, even with advanced leadership. The following description is not a substitute for common sense and experience. Do not underestimate the difficulty of descending this canyon. A rescue in this canyon would be dangerous and extremely complex. This canyon has a high flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Sleepy Hollow is rated 4B X IV using the Canyon Rating System. General Information: If you consider yourself an expert canyoneer that enjoys exposure and challenge this canyon might be what you are looking for. Sleepy Hollow requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 8 to 12 hours. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. This canyon contains extremely long sections of \"mae west\", that require good climbing skills over long periods of time without rest. This is an extremely physical canyon requiring constant downclimbing, climbing, stemming and chimneying. The canyon is exhausting both mentally and physically. The canyon has the potential to hold a lot of water, particularly at the beginning of the slot and in the long dark corridor near the end of the technical section. You probably only need wetsuits in cool or wet conditions, but to error on the side of caution until more is known about the characteristics of this canyon full wetsuits are recommended. Because this is a long X-rated canyon, if there is a lot of water, you could get hypothermia if you are not able to move quickly enough through the troublesome parts. The route contains several rappels with the longest being 60-feet. A 120-foot rope, a mae west bunny strap, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. The lighter and smaller your pack the better. A GPS is very useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"King Mesa\" is essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Sleepy Hollow use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sleepy.htm 1/25/2018 Sleepy Hollow - Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 and travel 33.0 miles to a turn-off signed \"Chimney Rock\" on the east (left) side of the road (N37° 23' 35\" W111° 08' 36\"). Follow the Chimney Rock road for 3.6 miles, passing Chimney Rock, to a nice overlook. This nice overlook is the Sleepy Hollow Trailhead. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. There are several nice primitive camp spots along the final section of road. The trailhead is accessible to carefully driven passenger vehicles in normal weather conditions. During periods of stormy weather the Hole-In- The-Rock Road has been known to wash out in sections. When the road is washed out a 4x4 is required. Route Information: From the Sleepy Hollow Trailhead (N37° 24' 59\" W111° 05' 55\") hike northeast towards a side drainage (N37° 25' 24\" W111° 05' 33\"). Hike down the side drainage to the bottom of Coyote Gulch (N37° 25' 37\" W111° 05' 08\"). Hike down Coyote Gulch for a short distance until you are stopped by a fence with a gate. The fence is a good place to stash some extra water for the hike out. Immediately up canyon from the fence is a slickrock exit to the north, which will allow you to gain access to the canyon rim. Hike north and route find your way to the top of the bench. Soon you will have nice views of Sleepy Hollow to the east (right), enjoy the views. Continue route finding north until you can hike into the bottom of Sleepy Hollow (N37° 27' 08\" W111° 04' 45\"). The approach should take approximately 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Once in the bottom of Sleepy Hollow it's time to don your armor (knee & elbow pads) and harness up for bunny strapping a serious mae west slot. Head down canyon and into the first section of narrows which should take approximately 30 to 60 minutes. This section of canyon is R-rated stemming with easy features and a little exposure to get you warmed up. At first it starts shallow and then it gradually dives deeper with nice swirling narrows. Many potholes can be stemmed over with skill. At the end of this section is a nice open area before some large boulders. This is a nice place to stop, snack, and re-hydrate before tackling the challenging and rewarding lower X-rated slot. After resting in the open area, downclimb to the right of the boulders and make your way to an obvious tight slot. Enter this slot several feet and you will find a nice chimney to upclimb above the tight part to a nice stemming stance 30 to 40-feet up. Once all of your party is up, head down canyon for the next 1.5 to 2.5 hours. You will never touch ground through this section. This is where you will want your bunny strap as you initially move around some S-curves before the canyon becomes more of a straight shot with bends spaced throughout. There is usually a reasonable place to rest every so often, where the canyon wall on one side has features or becomes low angle where you can rest 50-feet up. Navigating through these narrows is relatively easy for a high stemming canyon as there aren't many ups and downs. Minimizing the ups and downs should be your canyon leaders objective by staying high to conserve energy. When you are almost through the X-rated section you will encounter the canyons first crux. The canyon widens where you need to place your back against one wall and your feet against the other. The taller you are the easier it will be, the shorter the scarier, but most people over 5'-8\" will be able to reach comfortably. Each member of your party must be able to complete this move as belaying is impossible. You will be at least 50-feet above the canyon bottom and it is wider than the previous sections. Shortly after the crux you will see a stretch of canyon that becomes too wide at the level you've been and there is no choice but to head down. If you look down at this point there will be a natural bridge you can downclimb through to the canyon bottom. Keep going downstream until a side drainage enters from the east (left), some refer to this side drainage as \"Pothole Fork\". This is a good place to eat lunch and hydrate. As mentioned before, this section of canyon will take approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours to complete. Shortly below the Pot Hole Fork you will encounter a rappel where you squeeze through a hole between the wall and go under a large chokestone. This rappel is 60-feet. From the rappel walk downstream until your first downclimb, which guards the second crux. Downclimb to a chokestone, this chokestone should have webbing on it. Downstream you will see a second chokestone that you will want to make your way towards. You will want to rig a rappel from the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sleepy.htm 1/25/2018 Sleepy Hollow - Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 first chokestone with webbing and then downclimb to the next chokestone carefully laying the rope over the top so it doesn't get wedged between the chokestone and canyon wall. Rappel with the rope resting on the top of the second chokestone to the canyon floor which is 30-feet. This can be downclimbed by the skilled. Downstream from here the canyon turns into a slanted corridor and gets really dark. Put on your headlamp and enjoy this really intriguing hallway. Near the end of this corridor you will be forced to climb up and stem to where the canyon opens up briefly. From here until the end there is moderate stemming which gradually becomes easier until you can walk in the bottom of some pretty nice narrows. Soon the canyon widens with large boulders to crawl under and hike over until your last rappel of 50-feet into the lower lush portion of Sleepy Hollow. From the Pothole Fork to the final rappel will require approximately 1.5 to 2 hours. While hiking out the lower section of Sleepy Hollow you will encounter numerous crystal clear pools, green cottonwoods, and scenic alcoves. Follow hiker trails keeping a watchful eye out for poison ivy. When you reach Coyote Gulch (N37° 25 34\" W111° 04' 40\"), turn west (right) and hike upstream until you reach the fence you encountered earlier in the route. The hike from the last rappel to the fence should take approximately 1 hour. From the fence to the trailhead should take approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Caution: Sections of this route pass near areas of poison ivy. The poison ivy is easy to avoid if you know what to look for. Poison ivy has three leaves and is frequently found near water. Poison ivy leaves are green in the summer and red in the fall. Educate yourself before attempting this route.

The route consists of a scenic, engaging upper canyon with two sections of slot and a deep, aesthetic lower canyon. This is a great canyon for those entering the realm of technical canyoneering to gain some experience. General Information: Spencer Canyon is a great slot canyon that requires complete technical gear. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. Spencer Canyon is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. The route is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. The route can be downclimbed by the highly skilled but everyone else will require one or more short rappels or handlines. Better safe than sorry. Always remember, it is a long ways to mediocre medical care. A 100-foot rope is required along with 50-feet of webbing to rig required rappels or handlines. Spencer Canyon has the ability to hold a large amount of water. If conditions have been wet, or if you are doing the canyon in colder temperatures, wetsuits are advised as you will encounter several sections of wading and possible swimming. If have conditions have been dry, the canyon may only contain a few wades. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 4 to 6 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Red Breaks\" is essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Spencer Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 10.6 miles east on Highway 12 to the unsigned Spencer Flat Road (N37° 44' 34\", W111° 26' 54\"). Spencer Flat Road is located at mile marker 70.0 on Highway 12. The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right if coming from Escalante) on the Spencer Flat Road and travel 5.8 miles, where you will come to a split in the road (N37° 42' 47\", W111° 22' 24\"). There will be a sign at the road junction that says \"Horse and foot traffic welcome.\" At this junction, the main, better maintained Spencer Flat Road makes a hard right (to the south). You will want to stay straight (to the east) on the smaller road at this junction. Continue down the smaller road 0.9 miles until you come to a brown BLM sign that has been placed in the middle of the road, this is the Spencer Canyon Trailhead. Park at the trailhead or back up a hundred yards to a more open area where you can park off of the road. The trailhead is accessible to all high clearance 2wd vehicles in normal weather conditions. However, after heavy rains, there may be some wash crossings that require high clearance 4wd vehicles. Please check the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument roads report for the latest conditions on Spencer Flat Road. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/spencer.htm 1/25/2018 Spencer Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. There is reasonable primitive camping off of the Spencer Flat Road on your way into the trailhead. Camping near the trailhead would be exposed. Route Information: From the Spencer Canyon Trailhead (N37° 42' 37\", W111° 21' 25\") follow the closed dirt track to the east. The track is very sandy, and has a lot of Moqui marbles in some locations. After about 3/4 miles, you will come to another brown BLM sign in the middle of the road that marks the Wilderness Study Area (WSA) boundary (N37° 42' 33.3\", W111° 20' 39\"). After the WSA marker, stay on the sandy road for about 150-yards and then cut off the road to the north (left) and go cross-country in a northeast direction. There is no defined trail or obvious landmarks in this area. Choose a path of least resistance. Your objective is to get to reach the head of the Entry Canyon (N37° 42' 48.8\", W111° 20' 26.7\"). From the head of the Entry Canyon head downstream. There will be some downclimbing and minor route finding to find the easiest way down. Some people may want a handline or spot for some of the downclimbs. The canyon deepens as you go further down, with an increasingly taller and more vertical wall on the west (left) side. Towards the bottom of the entry canyon, the canyon takes a sharp bend to the right and enters a narrow slot section that will require downclimbing to enter. Some people may want a handline or spot for this downclimb. Continue downstream. Once the Entry Canyon opens up, be on the lookout for a deep, narrow canyon located on the east (right) side of the entry canyon. This is your objective and the main fork of Spencer Canyon. At this location, there may be a small pool at the base of a dryfall on the left side. If you continue straight and you start going uphill, you have gone too far. The beginning of the main fork of Spencer Canyon is about a 50-foot drop into a dark, narrow corridor. This drop can be downclimbed by the skilled, but most others will want to rappel or have a handline. This is the only rappel on the route. In wet conditions, the bottom part of the drop may be very wet. Please use good judgment if attempting the downclimb. There are good options for constructing a natural anchor at the top of this drop. If conditions are wet, you will want to put on your wetsuits at the top of the drop. At the bottom of the drop, there will be a series of wades or swims depending on the water levels. Continue downstream, wading or swimming through long hallways, and downclimbing. The canyon gets more open the further downstream you go. After about a mile in the canyon, you will come to an open 4-way junction (N37° 42' 58\", W111° 19' 17\"), where a wide, sandy canyon comes in from both the left and right sides. This is the end of the main fork of Spencer Canyon and the location of your exit route. If you are not pressed for time, drop your packs and spend some time exploring the various side canyons in this area. From the 4-way canyon junction turn south (right) and go up the wide sandy canyon for about 250-yards, passing two smaller, tighter side canyons. You are aiming for a sandstone ridge (N37° 42' 52\", W111° 19' 16\") that comes down between two side canyons. Once you get to this point, look on your west (right) side and try to locate the cairned route up the sandstone ridge. Follow the cairned route up the sandstone, passing point (N37° 42' 50\", W111° 19' 20\"). Depending on your route, you may also pass a USGS survey marker on this route. There are some short sections of scrambling involved with this exit. Once you reach the top of the sandstone ridge, the terrain flattens out considerably. Continue traveling west, aiming for this point (N37° 42' 45\", W111° 19' 44\") at the end of the slickrock. Your next objective is to rejoin the old sandy jeep track that you started the day on. You will want to go west-southwest until you intercept the sandy jeep track. Set your GPS for the WSA marker you passed earlier in the day ensure you are headed in the right direction. Once you reach the WSA marker, stay on the sandy jeep track back to the Spencer Canyon Trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/spencer.htm 1/25/2018 Spencer Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/spencer.htm 1/25/2018 Top Chef Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 1 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Top Chef AKA: Little Middle Baker Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument Technical Canyoneering Top Chef is a spectacular and seldom visited technical canyon. The canyon remained hidden for years as the neighboring canyons experienced a rush of popularity. But thanks to some enterprising canyoneers with the desire to explore the unknown this canyons enchanting secrets are now unlocked. General Information: Top Chef is an astonishing canyon tucked into a corner of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. The canyon contains many delights for the technical canyoneer. Top Chef Canyon requires complete technical gear. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. Summer would be miserable. Top Chef is rated 3B VI using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 11 to 13 hours of actual hiking time if doing the complete canyon in one long day. However, this canyon is usually done as part of a combo platter with other canyons in the area. A bivouac along the Escalante River is a popular option for a more enjoyable and shorter day. If using the combo platter option the canyon is rated 3B III and total time required from camp to camp is a more leisurely 6 to 8 hours of actual hiking time. In normal conditions this canyon has the ability to hold a large amount of water and full wetsuits are required. You will encounter several sections of wading and swimming. The route contains several rappels with the longest being 100-feet and requiring 200-feet of rope. Additional gear should consist of 50-feet of webbing, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, several rapid links and a prusik system. A Sandtrap or a couple of potshots would be good insurance to have along as an emergency anchor at the second rappel if the current anchor happens to wash out. Trekking poles for hiking the Escalante River and bushwhacking through the Escalante jungle are tremendously helpful to have along on this adventure. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Egypt\" and \"Scorpion Gulch\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Top Chef Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Create Your Own Combo Meal: Top Chef Canyon is usually completed in combination with one or more other routes. Bon Apetit, Neon, Ringtail, Baker and Choprock are all located in the same general vicinity along the Escalante River. The typical combo platter is to backpack down to the Escalante River, set up a base camp, and complete multiple canyons over several days. If the Escalante is running clear you can easily pump water from it. During spring runoff and after large upstream storms the Escalante River water will contain large amounts of silt that http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/topchef.htm 1/25/2018 Top Chef Canyon - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 will clog your water purification pumps. For this reason having a method of letting the silt settle out of your water before pumping is recommended. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road and travel 16.5 miles to a turn-off signed \"Egypt\" on the east (left) side of the road. Follow the Egypt Road for 9.5 miles to a fork in the road. Take the east (right) fork and drive 0.5 miles to the Egypt Trailhead. There is reasonable primitive camping along the last 2 miles of the Egypt Road. The trailhead is usually accessible to all high clearance 2wd vehicles in normal weather conditions. At times the last mile of road before the actual trailhead can become washed out and require 4-wheel drive. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Route Information: From the Egypt Trailhead (N37° 35' 35\", W111° 13' 07\") follow the cairned route northeast as it descends to the first bench you see from the rim. From here hike east-southeast for approximately 3-miles to a sand hill entrance (N37° 34' 46\" W111° 09' 40\"), that allows access down to the Escalante River. The 3 miles of hiking on the bench will require cross-country travel without any obvious visual landmarks to aim for and will require going up, over, and around various small features on the bench. Keep to the south of side canyons and sandstone domes as you approach the sand hill entrance. From the sand hill entrance hike northeast and route find your way down a ridge and sand hills (N37° 35' 00\" W111° 09' 11\"). Keep hiking downhill until you reach the Escalante River (N37° 35' 04\" W111° 08' 44\"). No scrambling is required to reach the river. If you find yourself cliffed out look around for an easier route. Once at the river setup a base camp. You will probably want to search both up and downstream a short distance to find a desirable campsite with vegetation to your liking. There are several open areas if you cross the river and go downstream a short distance. From the point where you reached the Escalante River hike downstream 1 1/4 mile to where Baker Canyon (N37° 35' 06\" W111° 07' 45\") enters from the north (left). Note that this section of hiking will require numerous river crossings and route finding through the sometimes thick vegetation along the Escalante River. If you get stuck in the jungle try to get back to the river or walk perpendicular to the river to see if you can find a better route. From Baker Canyon continue hiking downstream an addition 1/2 mile to where Twentyfive Mile Wash (N37° 34' 46\" W111° 07' 45\") enters west (right). From Twentyfive Mile Wash continue hiking downstream and additional 3/4 mile to the next large bend (N37° 34' 14\" W111° 07' 44\") to the east (left) in the Escalante River, at which point you will want to locate access onto the east (left) bench. After ascending through the first cliff band hike across the grassy bench in a northeast direction and locate a set of moki steps (N37° 34' 22\" W111° 07' 36\"). The moki steps are difficult to identify from a distance, but seek and you shall find. You must climb up the moki steps for approximately 40-feet. The crux of the climb is located near the top with an estimated rating of 5.5 YDS. From the top of the moki steps continue route finding up to the next level by hiking across the slickrock. Upon reaching the next level hike for 1 1/4 miles in a northeast direction to the head of a small canyon (N37° 34' 55\" W111° 06' 52\"). Cross the small canyon and ascend to a small pass (N37° 35' 00\" W111° 06' 41\"). From the small pass the head of Top Chef (N37° 34' 58\" W111° 06' 33\") is located in the drainage right in front of you. Route find your way down the slickrock to the canyon bottom. Navigating your way from base camp to the head of Top Chef will take approximately 2 to 2 1/2 hours. From the head of Top Chef let the real fun begin. As you begin hiking downstream you will encounter a very nice subway section of easy walking with a few downclimbs.

The rappel will probably deposit you in pool of water. Shortly after the first rappel you will encounter a second 25-foot rappel that will also deposit you in a pool of water. Rigging this rappel could be tricky. The rappel is normally rigged from a deadman anchor, but this section of canyon can be lacking in natural anchor building material. A Sandtrap or a couple of stacked potshots will easily allow for safe passage. After the second rappel you will crawl under a large boulder and encounter multiple potholes. The potholes should never be keepers and a party of two should always be able to partner assist out of them. The next obstacle you will encounter is an undercut drop of 8-feet into a pothole. A body anchored rappel from above and partner assist from below will defeat this obstacle. After this the canyon opens up and contains a few downclimbs. Near the end of the open section you will want to stay on an obvious bench to the west (right) to avoid several potholes. At the end of this bench are several large rocks that will provide an anchor and allow you to rappel 100-feet to the canyon bottom. After this rappel the exit to the Escalante seems like it might require an additional rappel, however there is a walk-off route with a few easy downclimbs to the up-river side of the bench you are on that will enable you to get back to the Escalante River (N37° 34' 29\" W111° 06' 46\"). It will take approximately 2 to 3 hours to negotiate the technical section of Top Chef depending on your skill set and how much time you spend taking pictures. After downclimbing to the Escalante, it will take you approximately 2 hours to hike back upstream to your base camp. Video: Enjoy a short video from Top Chef Canyon.

Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Zebra Canyon & Tunnel Slot Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument Canyoneering A reasonable easy hike to two great slot canyons the entire family can enjoy. Zebra Canyon is a photographers delight with it's unique white and pink stripes, while Tunnel Slot is a fun introduction to your typical Colorado Plateau slot canyon. Visiting both of these slots makes a nice day for your typical hiking family. General Information: Zebra Canyon and Tunnel Slot are awesome slot canyons easily accessible to most hikers and photographers. The route is suitable for beginning hikers. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. This route is rated 1A II using the Canyon Rating System. In normal conditions you might find some wading ranging from ankle deep to waist deep depending on recent conditions. It's also possible you will find both slots completely dry. Go prepared for at least some minor wading. Total round trip time required to visit both slot canyons is approximately 4 to 5 hours. A GPS is helpful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Tenmile Flat\" are valuable tools. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Navigation for this route is moderate. There is hiker trail for most of the way which is not difficult to follow. Mistakes in navigation are easy to overcome and correct on this route. These canyons have a mild flashflood danger, check the local weather before entering these slot canyons. Trailhead Information: From Main and Center in the town of Escalante, Utah travel 5.0 miles east on Highway 12 to the signed Hole-In-The-Rock Road (N37° 43' 39\", W111° 31' 54\"). The maintained gravel road is located on the south side of Highway 12. Turn south (right) on Hole-In-The-Rock Road and travel 7.9 miles to a cattle guard, just past the cattle guard is a small parking area on the south (right) side of the road. This is the Zebra Canyon and Tunnel Slot Trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in normal weather conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Route Information: From the Zebra Canyon and Tunnel Slot Trailhead (N37° 38' 22\", W111° 26' 43\") find a well defined hiker trail heading northeast from the cattle guard. Follow the trail for 2 miles until it intersects Harris Wash (N37° 39' 22\", W111° 25' 09\"). The canyon directly in front of you on the northeast side of Harris Wash is Zebra Canyon (N37° 39' 42\", W111° 25' 02\"). Zebra Canyon is wide and open where it joins Harris Wash but soon narrows up into a beautiful deep slot canyon with its famous pink and white zebra stripes. at the head of the slot you will encounter a small dryfall, this is the end of Zebra Canyon. You can scramble up the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/zebra.htm 1/25/2018 Zebra Canyon and Tunnel Slot - Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument - Canyon... Page 2 of 2 dryfall but the slot opens back up and become much less interesting. Zebra Canyon often contains ankle deep wading, occasionally the wading can be waist deep. After exploring Zebra Canyon return to Harris Wash. Hike east (downstream) in Harris Wash for 3/4 mile following a hiker trail to the first side canyon entering from the north (left) side (N37° 39' 09\", W111° 24' 26\"). This is Tunnel Slot. Hike up Tunnel Slot to where the canyon narrows and the tunnel is formed (N37° 39' 19\", W111° 24' 23\"). The tunnel section often contains a pool of water.

212 Devil's Thumb - Dante Canyons Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Devil's Thumb Dante Canyon System Lake Powell Technical Canyoneering The Dante Canyon System is made up of four short and challenging canyons. From west to east the canyons are Devil's Thumb, Purgatory, Inferno, Limbo and Paradiso. Normally two of these canyons are combined to create a full day of canyoneering. These canyons are remote and drain an area known as Ticaboo Mesa. General Information: Devil's Thumb is unique to the Dante Canyon System as it is the only canyon that contains Anasazi Ruins. Devil's Thumb requires complete technical gear and is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 to 5 hours. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. The longest mandatory rappel in the canyon is 55-feet. Recommended gear is a 120-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100-feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system. Wetsuits are not normally required in this canyon. The canyon might contain water in wet conditions. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the charm. Most problems in this canyon are easy to defeat using a little teamwork and ingenuity. The sandstone in this slot is very soft. Please construct rappel anchors that do not create rope grooves when you pull your ropes. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. There are no trails in the area and route finding skills are required. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. Trailhead Information: The Dante Canyon System is not directly accessible from the waters of Lake Powell. The Dante Canyon System is accessed from a four-wheel-drive road 2 miles north of Ticaboo, Utah. You will need the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" and \"Lost Spring\" to access this trailhead. The Dante System Trailhead can usually be reached by high clearance two wheel drive vehicles. Four-wheel-drive vehicles will have no problem reaching the trailhead. The roads in this area vary seasonally. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Not all roads described are noted on the USGS maps. From Ticaboo drive north on Highway 276 for 2.0 miles. Turn east (right) on a dirt road (N37° 41' 50\", W110° 40' 16\"). Follow the dirt road for 5.3 miles to a junction (N37° 40' 46\", W110° 36' 15\"). Turn north (left) and follow the dirt road for 1.6 miles to a junction at a big U in the road (N37° 41' 43\", W110° 35' 03\"). Turn south (right) and follow the road for 0.1 miles to a fork (N37° 41' 37\", W110° 35' 06\"). Take the east (left) fork and follow the road 0.3 miles to a second fork (N37° 41' 29\", W110° 34' 48\"). Take the east (left) fork and follow the road for 1.1 miles to where a road joins from the west (N37° 41' 02\", W110° 33' 50\"), continue east (left) and follow the road 0.4 miles to a junction (N37° 41' 02\", W110° 33' 21\"). Turn north (left) and http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/dante-devilsthumb.htm 1/25/2018 Devil's Thumb - Dante Canyons Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 follow the road 1.0 miles to a junction (N37° 41' 45\", W110° 33' 11\"). Turn south (right) and follow the road 1.1 miles to the Dante Canyon System Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify because the road ends at a beautiful overlook of Lake Powell and the fingers of the Dante Canyon System. Camping can be found at the trailhead, but is not recommended if you are camping in a tent because the wind never stops blowing across the top of Ticaboo Mesa. There are several camp sites about a mile or two after leaving Highway 276 that provide a better option for primitive camping. Route Information: From the Dante Canyon System Trailhead (N37° 41' 12\", W110° 32' 11\"), locate a social trail to the south of the trailhead and route find your way to the slickrock bench below. Traverse cross-country southwest for a little over 1/2 mile to the Devil's Thumb drainage (N37° 40' 47\", W110° 32' 38\"). Head downstream hiking around or over the dryfalls you encounter. Soon you will reach a pothole section that has difficult anchor and partner assist issues. This section can be bypassed by route finding to the south (right) and downclimbing into a side drainage that allows you to scramble to the canyon bottom. Once back in the canyon bottom continue downstream over a couple minor downclimbs until stopped by a 15-foot rappel that deposits you in a pothole. A partner assist is required to escape the pothole. Immediately after the pothole there is a 20-foot rappel into a second pothole and then a downclimb (or handline) to a small ledge and a 35-foot rappel. This rappel is anchored by placing a knot chock in a very nice constriction on the north (left) side of the canyon. This rappel places you on a ledge with an Anasazi ruin. The ruin has been cataloged by Northern Arizona University (UT-6-9) and is a crude dry stack ruin. The ruin contains a complete mano and metate, which are becoming rare to see together outside of a museum. This ruin was likely cataloged by Northern Arizona University (NAU) in the Glen Canyon Survey before Lake Powell was filled. Please leave all artifacts behind and take only pictures. After visiting the ruin you have two choices, you can negotiate the potholes beneath the ruin or you can transverse north (left) to a 40-foot rappel that will place you on a ledge where you will find a slung rock in a crack. This is the anchor for the 55-foot rappel that will deposit you on the canyon floor. After the 55-foot rappel hike down canyon for 1/2 mile until you see the ridge between Limbo and Paradiso (N37° 40' 43\", W110° 31' 44\"), this is your exit. The ridge is currently marked with a cairn. Route find your way up the broken rock. After gaining the first level traverse right and then route find your way up the nose and fins of steep slickrock to the layer of slickrock you started on before first dropping into the slot. Hike back to the trailhead. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/dante-devilsthumb.htm 1/25/2018 Inferno - Dante Canyons Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Inferno Canyon Dante Canyon System Lake Powell Technical Canyoneering The Dante Canyon System is made up of four short and challenging canyons. From west to east the canyons are Devil's Thumb, Purgatory, Inferno, Limbo and Paradiso. Normally two of these canyons are combined to create a full day of canyoneering. These canyons are remote and drain an area known as Ticaboo Mesa. General Information: Inferno requires complete technical gear and is rated 3B II using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 4 hours. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. The longest mandatory rappel in the canyon is 65-feet and requires two 70-foot ropes, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100-feet of webbing, several rapid links, a prusik system and three pot shots (throw bags). Wetsuits are not normally required in this canyon. The canyon might contain water in wet conditions. Some of the potholes along this route have the ability to hold water for long periods of time. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the charm. Most problems in this canyon are easy to defeat using a little teamwork and ingenuity. The sandstone in this slot is very soft. Please construct rappel anchors that do not create rope grooves when you pull your ropes. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. There are no trails in the area and route finding skills are required. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. Trailhead Information: The Dante Canyon System is not directly accessible from the waters of Lake Powell. The Dante Canyon System is accessed from a four-wheel-drive road 2 miles north of Ticaboo, Utah. You will need the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" and \"Lost Spring\" to access this trailhead. The Dante System Trailhead can usually be reached by high clearance two wheel drive vehicles. Four-wheel-drive vehicles will have no problem reaching the trailhead. The roads in this area vary seasonally. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Not all roads described are noted on the USGS maps. From Ticaboo drive north on Highway 276 for 2.0 miles. Turn east (right) on a dirt road (N37° 41' 50\", W110° 40' 16\"). Follow the dirt road for 5.3 miles to a junction (N37° 40' 46\", W110° 36' 15\"). Turn north (left) and follow the dirt road for 1.6 miles to a junction at a big U in the road (N37° 41' 43\", W110° 35' 03\"). Turn south (right) and follow the road for 0.1 miles to a fork (N37° 41' 37\", W110° 35' 06\"). Take the east (left) fork and follow the road 0.3 miles to a second fork (N37° 41' 29\", W110° 34' 48\"). Take the east (left) fork and follow the road for 1.1 miles to where a road joins from the west (N37° 41' 02\", W110° 33' 50\"), continue east (left) and follow the road 0.4 miles to a junction (N37° 41' 02\", W110° 33' 21\"). Turn north (left) and http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/dante-inferno.htm 1/25/2018 Inferno - Dante Canyons Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 follow the road 1.0 miles to a junction (N37° 41' 45\", W110° 33' 11\"). Turn south (right) and follow the road 1.1 miles to the Dante Canyon System Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify because the road ends at a beautiful overlook of Lake Powell and the fingers of the Dante Canyon System. Camping can be found at the trailhead, but is not recommended if you are camping in a tent because the wind never stops blowing across the top of Ticaboo Mesa. There are several camp sites about a mile or two after leaving Highway 276 that provide a better option for primitive camping. Route Information: From the Dante Canyon System Trailhead (N37° 41' 12\", W110° 32' 11\"), observe the second drainage system to your east. This canyon is known as Inferno and it is your destination. Locate a social trail to the northeast of the trailhead and route find your way to the slickrock below. Hike east circumventing the two prongs that form the head of Purgatory (N37° 41' 13\", W110° 32' 01\"), and traverse easterly to the head of Inferno (N37° 41' 08\", W110° 31' 53\"). Hike around the east (left) side of Inferno and downclimb into the shallow slot . Enjoy easy stemming, downclimbing and some squeezing. Partner assists will be required on a few of the minor obstacles. Soon you will encounter the first rappel of 60-feet. This is a three-stage rappel anchored from a chokestone. Immediately after the first rappel is a short tight hallway most will have to stem up to get through. After the tight hallway are several downclimbs the canyon opens to form a nice long hallway followed by a narrowing slot that forms a long left leaning hallway that requires mild stemming. The canyon opens and you will shortly encounter the second rappel of 15-feet anchored by a deadman. Continue downstream hiking and downclimbing through a section of potholes that can be skirted around the sides. The pothole section ends at a 35-foot rappel into a semi-keeper pothole. If the semi-keeper pothole contains water, you can rappel to some small ledges and traverse around the side of the pothole. This option is for the talented and failure comes complete with penalty points. After the semi-keeper pothole continue hiking and downclimbing until you reach a two- stage rappel of 65-feet. This rappel is anchored from a rock cairn. Immediately after this rappel is the final rappel of 50-feet anchored from a deadman in a pothole. After the final rappel hike downstream for a few minutes and locate the ridge between Limbo and Paradiso (N37° 40' 43\", W110° 31' 44\"), this is your exit. The ridge is currently marked with a cairn. Route find your way up the broken rock. After gaining the first level traverse right and then route find your way up the nose and fins of steep slickrock to the layer of slickrock you started on before first dropping into the slot.

These canyons are remote and drain an area known as Ticaboo Mesa. General Information: Limbo is probably the most difficult of the Dante Canyon System because of the advanced natural anchor problems you might encounter. The true difficulty with the anchors depends on your skills, the tools you have available, and if the group before you left a reasonable anchor intact. Limbo requires complete technical gear and is rated 3A II R using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 4 to 5 hours. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground.

Route Information: From the Dante Canyon System Trailhead (N37° 41' 12\", W110° 32' 11\"), locate a social trail to the northeast of the trailhead and route find your way to the slickrock bench below. Hike east circumventing the two prongs that form the head of Purgatory (N37° 41' 13\", W110° 32' 01\"), traverse around the head of Inferno (N37° 41' 08\", W110° 31' 53\") and continue east to the head of Limbo (N37° 41' 09\", W110° 31' 46\"). The canyon begins with easy stemming and downclimbing. About ten minutes into the canyon will be a partner assisted downclimb of 15-feet, immediately followed by a 20-foot downclimb, followed by the first rappel of 30-feet. The anchor for the first rappel poses a tough geometry problem and there is very little anchor material to work with. The current anchor is a small rock used as a deadman buried approximately 20-feet back from the lip of the rappel. The rappel is followed by a downclimb which leads to a 50-foot rappel anchored from a chokestone. This drop can be downclimbed by the skilled. Immediately around the corner is a silo to stem over with some hollow rock on the east (left) side. Use caution as the silo is the crux of the route. The stem over the top isn't difficult, but you certainly don't want to fall. After the silo you can skirt a shallow pothole to the west (right), or climb through it if you desire. Next up is a partner assisted downclimb of 20-feet. followed by large fallen rocks which require crawling under and over. Next you will encounter a 20-foot rappel, followed by several more downclimbs. Soon the canyon opens up and you are presented with a two-stage rappel of 100-feet total height. The rappel ends in a spring that can be avoided with a little effort. After the final rappel hike downstream for a few minutes and locate the ridge on your east (left) side between Limbo and Paradiso (N37° 40' 43\", W110° 31' 44\"), this is your exit.

Route Information: From the Dante Canyon System Trailhead (N37° 41' 12\", W110° 32' 11\"), observe the first canyon nearest you, this is your destination. Locate a social trail to the northeast of the trailhead and route find your way to the slickrock bench below. Purgatory has two very small prongs at the head of the canyon, you want the prong furthest to the east (N37° 41' 13\", W110° 32' 01\"). Upon reaching the head of the east prong skip the difficult downclimb at the head of the prong, and hike on the east (left) side of the canyon for a few minutes until a walk-down presents itself. After hiking downstream a bit you will encounter a rappel from a knot block behind a flake. The rappel is only 10-feet, but will require 70-feet of rope because the anchor is located back from the lip of the rappel. The second rappel is located immediately after the first and is 40-feet high and anchored from two chokestones. Next up is the third rappel, which is 33-feet high and anchored from a boulder. The third rappel places you at the bottom of a long narrow section of slot canyon, hike down the narrows until the canyon opens at a rock slide. You can bypass the rockslide on the west (right) or simply downclimb the rockslide. After the rockslide is the fourth rappel, which begins by crawling under a huge chokestone. The rappel is anchored from a chokestone and is 30-feet high. Next up is a long twisty section of narrows that leads to the fifth rappel, which is a 3-stage rappel of 105-feet anchored from a natural bridge. The sixth rappel is a 2-stage rappel of 110-feet anchored from a chokestone. The sixth rappel deposits you at a pool that can be avoided with a little care. After the sixth rappel hike down canyon for 1/4 mile until you see the ridge between Limbo and Paradiso (N37° 40' 43\", W110° 31' 44\"), this is your exit. The ridge is currently marked with a cairn. Route find your way up the broken rock. After gaining the first level traverse right and then route find your way up the nose and fins of steep slickrock to the layer of slickrock you started on before first dropping into the slot. Hike back to the trailhead.

Technical Canyoneering Glaucoma is a technical slot canyon located on Lake Powell. This slot canyon is part of the Warm Springs Canyon System. Glaucoma is suitable for highly skilled and experienced canyoneers only. General Information: Glaucoma is a technical canyoneering adventure suitable for highly skilled canyoneers. The route is rated 4A X III using the Canyon Rating System. Much of the canyon contains solid \"R\" high stemming, it has an \"X\" rating because of an unprotected downclimb. Total time for this slot canyon is approximately 5 to 6 hours. The approach will require approximately one hour. You will spend about 30 minutes establishing your exit. The technical section of the canyon will require 2 or 3 hours. The exit will require approximately one hour. This route is for physically fit and highly experienced canyoneers only. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Lake Powell water level is not a concern as the route is not accessible from the lake. Glaucoma requires complete technical gear. This route requires three ropes. A 60-meter (200-foot) rope is required to rig the exit. A 60-foot rope is required to rig the entrance rappel, A 50-foot rope is required to work through the canyon and is adequate for defeating all obstacles you will encounter. Other technical equipment should include several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, several rapid links, 50-feet of webbing and a prusik system (preferably some nice handled ascenders). A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" and \"Knowles Canyon\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. There are no trails in the area and route finding skills are required. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. Check the local weather report before committing. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors which is moderately difficult in this canyon. Warning: If you attempt this canyon, every member of your group must be a highly skilled canyoneer and rock climber. This canyon is deadly for beginners. Glaucoma is NOT suitable for the general canyoneering public. Errors in technique or judgment will likely result in serious injury or death. Do not underestimate the difficulty and danger of descending this canyon. A rescue in this canyon would be hazardous and extremely troublesome. Trailhead Information: Glaucoma does not require a vehicle shuttle. The canyon is not accessible from Lake Powell and must be reached by four wheel drive. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/glaucoma.htm 1/25/2018 Glaucoma - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 the road described until told to turn off of it. Not all roads described are noted on the USGS maps. From Ticaboo drive north on Highway 276 for 2.0 miles. Turn east (right) on a dirt road (N37° 41' 50\", W110° 40' 16\"). Follow the dirt road for 5.3 miles to a junction (N37° 40' 46\", W110° 36' 15\"). Turn north (left) and follow the dirt road for 1.6 miles to a junction at a big U in the road (N37° 41' 43\", W110° 35' 03\"). Turn south (right) and follow the road for 0.1 miles to a fork (N37° 41' 37\", W110° 35' 06\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 3.5 miles to a second fork (N37° 39' 02\", W110° 36' 15\"). Take the south (left) fork and follow the road for 1.8 miles to the Glaucoma Trailhead. The trailhead makes for a nice campsite as it is in a low area that is out of the wind and contains a fire ring. Route Information: From the Glaucoma Trailhead (N37° 37' 37\" W110° 35' 33\"), hike south, cross-country, until you reach the rim and a good walk-down through the upper cliff band (N37° 37' 31\", W110° 35' 35\"). At this point the canyon directly in front of you is Glaucoma. Hike downstream skirting minor obstacles to the head of the technical slot (N37° 37' 07\", W110° 36' 15\"). IMPORTANT - Before descending the technical section you must establish an escape route by hanging a rope that you will climb out on later in the day. To establish this escape route rim walk down the north (right) side of the canyon until you see a break where there are some very shallow potholes on a steep wall. Outlining this break is a white ring of sandstone. Stay lower than this feature and a ramp to a bench will present itself for a hike down to a pothole with a deadman (N37° 37' 01\", W110° 36' 26\"). This is where you will establish your 60-meter escape rope. Lower a pack over the edge and make sure it touches the canyon bottom. Most of it is low angle until it goes over the edge where it is vertical. There might be some water in the slot at this point, so dry bag anything you don't want wet. It might also be wise to place some extra water and your ascending gear inside the pack you lower over the edge to reduce the gear you will need to carry through the slot canyon. After establishing your escape hike back to the head of the technical slot. As you can tell this is a very short canyon, but you should respect it. The upclimbs and silos aren't that hard, but the climbing is very sustained. Rappel from a cairn anchor on the south (left) side of the canyon and defeat the keeper pothole, or construct an anchor for a 60-foot rappel just past the keeper pothole to easily circumvent this obstacle. Downclimb and scramble downstream for about 30 minutes until you reach a big downclimb with no natural anchors to construct a rappel anchor. Most of the canyon gets an \"R\" rating, but this section is the only part of the canyon that gets an \"X\" rating since falling here would mean serious injury. The best climber should inspect the downclimb by rappelling off of a partner and then ascend to where he can be an anchor for the other party members. The downclimb should be done with no pack, you want to face south (left) and grab a fluted pinch near the beginning while getting established in the chimney - utilizing a chicken wing with the left hand is also essential. Once established in the chimney slide down until it bombays out at the bottom. Stemming and a spot from the bottom will get you down. The drop is about 45-feet and it isn't that bad once you get established. After the downclimb obstacle continue downstream, mostly high stemming between the canyon walls. There are usually good ledges and features for your feet and hands. After about one hour you will see a 40-foot elevator of which there is a room or chamber that must be stemmed over. It is slightly wider for several feet through this section but it isn't that difficult. You do not want to fall into this chamber. After the chamber the high stemming becomes more difficult because the climbing is sustained. You will find yourself climbing up and down the slot walls and encountering several narrow sections that you must negotiate. The features for your hands and feet remain which keeps the climbing from getting too difficult. The remaining canyon from the chamber to the exit should take about 1 1/2 hours, including the exit. The exit is a 200-foot low angle jug, that you established earlier in the day. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/glaucoma.htm 1/25/2018 Glaucoma - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/glaucoma.htm 1/25/2018 Good Day Jim - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 1 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Good Day Jim Lake Powell Technical Canyoneering The actual canyon name would be something like the West Prong of the East Fork of Sevenmile Creek, but everyone calls the route Good Day Jim (GDJ). This route is a fun and challenging romp through a great Lake Powell Slot Canyon. The beauty of this canyon is spectacular; the narrows are deep, tight and fun. Good Day Jim offers its enchantment with an enjoyable approach hike over slick rock. Some of the photographs used on this page are compliments of Bruce Neumann. Interested in viewing a short video which was shot in Good Day Jim? *Good Day Jim Canyon Video* General Information: Good Day Jim is an enjoyable technical canyoneering adventure. This is a amusing canyon requiring downclimbing, minor squeezing, partner assists and three rappels. Good Day Jim is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 6 to 7 hours. Lake Powell water level is not a concern, even with the reservoir at full pool. Good Day Jim requires complete technical gear. When it comes to predicting water this canyon can be a little tricky. Most groups report the route is completely dry or contains only a small amount of wading. But several groups have reported a large amount of swimming is required. The way I have it figured is the canyon drains relatively fast, but has the potential of holding a large amount of water. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A 50 meter rope is more then adequate for rigging all required rappels. No rappel is longer then 80-feet. Other technical equipment should include several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing and several rapid links. This route contains at least one keeper pothole that can be a little difficult to exit. The difficulty depends on water depth in the pothole. Do not enter a pothole and pull your rope until you have one member of your group safely out of the pothole. If you have trouble exiting a pothole consider using partner assist techniques. You can also use a pack toss, which consists of tying a rope to a backpack and tossing the pack over the lip of the pothole (hold on to the end of the rope). The backpack acts as a counterweight and will give you the advantage of using the rope as a handline which allows you to escape the pothole. Go prepare for various water levels and use your imagination and creativity to bypass the potholes. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors which is moderately difficult in this canyon. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. There are no trails in the area and route finding skills are required. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. Check the local weather report before committing. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/goodday.htm 1/25/2018 Good Day Jim - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Lake Powell Trailhead: Good Day Jim has two trailhead options. The first and most enjoyable is to access the canyon by boat from Lake Powell. This option has many advantages, the hike up is done in the cool morning and a lake swim at the finish are two of the more obvious reasons. Boats can be rented at Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell by contacting ARAMARK at (435) 684-3000 or online at Visit Lake Powell. The route used here is described using the Lake Powell Trailhead. From Bullfrog Marina travel approximately 21 miles upstream to channel buoy #113. 1/4 mile upstream of buoy #113, on the left side (west side) is the entrance to Sevenmile Creek. Enter Sevenmile Creek and take the first fork to the right (North), this is often referred to as the \"East Fork of Sevenmile Creek\". Travel to the end of the canyon where you should find several beaches where you can park your boat, this is the trailhead. This is also a reasonable camping spot if you are visiting for more than one day. Optional 4x4 Trailhead: If this canyon becomes popular the Optional 4x4 Trailhead will eventually become the prevalent route. The Optional 4x4 Trailhead is located by accessing a four wheel drive road 2 miles North of Ticaboo. You will need the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" and \"Lost Spring\" to access this trailhead. The Optional 4x4 Trailhead can usually be reached by high clearance two wheel drive vehicles, but there are a couple sandy sections the last couple of miles. 4x4 vehicles will have no problem reaching the trailhead. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Not all roads described are noted on the USGS map. From Ticaboo drive north on Highway 276 for 2.0 miles. Turn east (right) on a dirt road (N37° 41' 50\", W110° 40' 16\"). Follow the dirt road for 5.3 miles to a junction (N37° 40' 46\", W110° 36' 15\"). Turn north (left) and follow the dirt road for 1.6 miles to a junction at a big U in the road (N37° 41' 43\", W110° 35' 03\"). Turn south (right) and follow the road for 0.1 miles to a fork (N37° 41' 37\", W110° 35' 06\"). Take the east (left) fork and follow the road 0.3 miles to a second fork (N37° 41' 29\", W110° 34' 48\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road for 1.0 miles to where a road joins from the east (N37° 40' 49\", W110° 34' 12\"), continue south (straight ahead) and follow the road 1.3 miles to where a minor wash crosses the road. This is the Optional Good Day Jim Trailhead (N37° 39' 54\", W110° 33' 34\"). If using the Optional 4x4 Trailhead you will intersect the basic Lake Powell route at the Good Day Jim Drop In by hiking 3/4 miles southwest. Make certain you are entering the correct drainage. Using this trailhead will probably add about one hour to the required time listed for the route. Route Information: This route description assumes you are accessing the canyon from Lake Powell. Adjust as required if accessing from the Optional 4x4 Trailhead. From the Lake Powell Trailhead (N37° 38' 01\", W110° 34' 31\") it is necessary to gain the cap above the canyon. This is accomplished by working your way up a weakness in the west side sandstone wall. The bottom of the weakness (N37° 38' 12\", W110° 34' 31\") is easy to locate after climbing to the first bench above lake Powell. The top of the weakness (N37° 38' 18\", W110° 34' 40\") looks difficult to reach but involves nothing more serious than third class hiking if you are careful at route finding and follow the map. From the top of the weakness begin hiking north and you should soon begin to see Good Day Jim and Hard Day Harvey on your right (east) side. Continue hiking to the head of Good Day Jim canyon (N37° 39' 26\", W110° 34' 18\") where there are several easy walk downs to gain access to the canyon floor. Descending this canyon is fun and enjoyable. There are at least three rappels and a large number of downclimbs required to negotiate this route. The exact number of each depends on your skill and route. There are several sections where a partner assist or good climbing skills are required to negotiate an obstacle. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/goodday.htm 1/25/2018 Good Day Jim - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 About midway through the route you will encounter a 10-foot deep keeper pothole. This pothole can be difficult to exit because it is slightly overhanging at the exit point and the far side slopes away gradually. One method of defeating the pothole is with a pack toss. To get enough leverage you might be forced to toss a couple of packs over the pothole and combine this with a partner assist so you do not pull the packs back into the pothole. The packs should be tossed before you are in the soup. Those with solid pothole escape techniques should not have a problem. Below the keeper pothole you will encounter a second deep pothole that might be difficult to exit. You can see the pothole is going to be difficult before entering. If thrashing through the second pothole does not thrill you its possible to use ledges and circle around the pothole to the west (right). The choice is yours, but go prepared. Midway through the canyon the route joins up with Hard Day Harvey at a junction (N37° 38' 52\", W110° 34' 19\"). Just after the junction is the final rappel down a huge chokestone. After the final rappel the canyon begins to open up and become much easier. Near the bottom of the canyon, you will encounter a large pour-off with a spring and pool surrounded by cottonwood trees. The correct route is to hike around the right (west) side of the pour-off on a hiker made trail. You will soon reach the lake so get ready for an enjoyable swim.

This route is a fun, physically demanding and a technically challenging adventure. The beauty of this canyon is spectacular; the narrows are extremely tight, dramatic, unrelenting and perilous. Hard Day Harvey features what has become known as a \"Mae West Slot\", which is a \"V\" shaped slot so narrow that it is impossible to pass through. Hard Day Harvey offers its enchantment with an enjoyable approach hike over slick rock. Descent requires moderate rock climbing skills to climb over or bypass the \"Mae West\" portions of the canyon. Some of the photographs used on this page are compliments of Bruce Neumann. Interested in viewing a short video which was shot in Hard Day Harvey? *Hard Day Harvey Canyon Video* General Information: Hard Day Harvey is a spectacular technical canyoneering adventure. This canyon is not suitable for beginners. This is a very physical canyon requiring constant downclimbing, squeezing, stemming and chimneying. Good rock climbing skills are a must and sticky shoes are a bonus. Fat guys and buxom woman are going to find it impossibly difficult in several of the tight squeeze sections. Hard Day Harvey is rated 3A R III using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 7 to 8 hours. Lake Powell water level is not a concern, even with the reservoir at full pool. Hard Day Harvey requires complete technical gear. The canyon might contain minor chest deep wading in normal conditions. This canyon has the potential to hold a lot of water and swimming might be required after periods of heavy rain. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A 100-foot rope is more then adequate for rigging all required rappels. No rappel is longer then 45-feet. Other technical equipment should include several shoulder length slings, several rapid links, a couple of double length slings. You will need a minimum of 100-feet of webbing if anchors have been washed out or need replacing. Mae West canyons also require the use of a \"mae west bunny\" or bunny strap. This is a length or webbing or a daisy chain with a carabiner attached which will allow you to hang your pack from your harness while you chimney, climb and stem above and through the narrow slots. A bunny strap is a must have item. I prefer a daisy chain since it allows much more adjustment in where and how you attach your pack. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors which is moderately difficult in this canyon. I strongly suggest a long sleeve shirt and long pants for this slot or you will leave a bunch a skin on the canyon walls. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. There are no trails in the area and route finding skills are required. You must be certain http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/hardday.htm 1/25/2018 Hard Day Harvey - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. Check the local weather report before committing. Warning: Large frame canyoneers will have extreme difficulty descending Hard Day Harvey. My chest measurement is 43\" around. There are sections of this canyon that I found very difficult to squeeze through. At times I found it necessary to search up and down the vertical slot until I could locate a section wide enough to squeeze through. At least one section required climbing over the top of the tight slot. Bring as small of pack as possible. You have been warned! Lake Powell Trailhead: Hard Day Harvey has two trailhead options. The first and most enjoyable is to access the canyon by boat from Lake Powell. This option has many advantages, the hike up is done in the cool morning and a lake swim at the finish are two of the more obvious reasons. Boats can be rented at Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell by contacting ARAMARK at (435) 684-3000 or online at Visit Lake Powell. The route used here is described using the Lake Powell Trailhead. An Optional Trailhead is briefly noted and located on the map. From Bullfrog Marina travel approximately 21 miles upstream to channel buoy #113. 1/4 mile upstream of buoy #113, on the left side (west side) is the entrance to Sevenmile Creek. Enter Sevenmile Creek and take the first fork to the right (North), this is often referred to as the \"East Fork of Sevenmile Creek\". Travel to the end of the canyon where you should find several beaches where you can park your boat, this is the trailhead. This is also a reasonable camping spot if you are visiting for more than one day. Optional 4x4 Trailhead: If this canyon becomes popular the Optional 4x4 Trailhead will eventually become the prevalent route. The Optional 4x4 Trailhead is located by accessing a four wheel drive road 2 miles North of Ticaboo. You will need the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" and \"Lost Spring\" to access this trailhead. The Optional 4x4 Trailhead can usually be reached by high clearance two wheel drive vehicles, but there are a couple sandy sections the last couple of miles. 4x4 vehicles will have no problem reaching the trailhead. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Not all roads described are noted on the USGS map. From Ticaboo drive north on Highway 276 for 2.0 miles. Turn east (right) on a dirt road (N37° 41' 50\", W110° 40' 16\"). Follow the dirt road for 5.3 miles to a junction (N37° 40' 46\", W110° 36' 15\"). Turn north (left) and follow the dirt road for 1.6 miles to a junction at a big U in the road (N37° 41' 43\", W110° 35' 03\"). Turn south (right) and follow the road for 0.1 miles to a fork (N37° 41' 37\", W110° 35' 06\"). Take the east (left) fork and follow the road 0.3 miles to a second fork (N37° 41' 29\", W110° 34' 48\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road for 1.0 miles to where a road joins from the east (N37° 40' 49\", W110° 34' 12\"), continue south (straight ahead) and follow the road 1.5 miles to a small pullout on the north (left) side of the road near a minor wash. This is the Optional Hard Day Harvey Trailhead (N37° 39' 47\", W110° 33' 21\"). If using the Optional 4x4 Trailhead you will intersect the basic Lake Powell route at the Hard Day Harvey Drop In by hiking 1/4 miles south. Make certain you are entering the correct drainage. Route Information: This route description assumes you are accessing the canyon from Lake Powell. Adjust as required if accessing from the Optional 4x4 Trailhead. From the Lake Powell Trailhead (N37° 38' 01\", W110° 34' 31\") it is necessary to gain the cap above the canyon. This is accomplished by working your way up the ledges and minor side canyons to your east. There are several options and nothing more serious than third class hiking is required if you are careful at route finding and follow the map. After reaching the upper cap you should be rewarded with outstanding views of Lake Powell. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/hardday.htm 1/25/2018 Hard Day Harvey - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 From the view area begin hiking north and you should soon begin to see Hard Day Harvey on your left (west) side. Continue hiking to the head of the canyon where you will find the initial entrance rappel (N37° 39' 39\", W110° 33' 29\"). This rappel is anchored from a large boulder. Descending this canyon is very physical and time consuming. There are 4 to 6 rappels depending on your skills, combined with a large number of downclimbs and squeezes. There are several sections where a partner assist or good climbing skills are required to exit deep potholes. These are not what I would call keeper potholes but they can sometimes be tricky to exit. Midway through the canyon the route joins up with Good Day Jim at a junction (N37° 38' 52\", W110° 34' 19\"). There are no more tight squeezes required to continue. Just after the junction is the final rappel down a huge chokestone. After the final rappel the canyon begins to open up and become much easier. Near the bottom of the canyon, you will encounter a large pour-off with a spring and pool surrounded by cottonwood trees. The correct route is to hike around the right (west) side of the pour-off on a hiker made trail. You will soon reach the lake so get ready for an enjoyable swim.

The canyon was well known in the senior canyoneering community as Bum Fodder in the early years of the sport. But in 2005 a party of canyoneers became stranded over night in the slot during a flash flood. When telling their story after the epic they laughing referred to the psychological damage they suffer, and a new name was born. Warning: If you attempt this canyon, every member of your group must be a highly skilled canyoneer and rock climber. This canyon is deadly for beginners. Psycho D is NOT suitable for the general canyoneering public and is rated 4A X III using the Canyon Rating System. Errors in technique or judgment will likely result in serious injury or death. Do not underestimate the difficulty and danger of descending this canyon. A rescue in this canyon would be hazardous and extremely troublesome. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. General Information: Psycho D is a technical canyoneering adventure that requires complete technical gear. This route is considered by many to be one of the most difficult slot canyons on the Colorado Plateau. This canyon is easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. This canyon would be laborious in hot weather. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 6 to 7 hours. This is a physical canyon requiring downclimbing, climbing, stemming and chimneying. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Bullfrog\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for Psycho D use the WGS84 datum. Bring as small and light of pack as possible. In normal conditions this canyon might require wading or even a short swim right at it's exit. A long sleeve shirt and long pants are highly suggested for this slot or you will leave some skin. Knee pads, elbow pads, helmet, harness and mae west bunny strap are also required. There are no rappels in this canyon but the climbing is difficult. A 75-foot rope is suggested for hand lines and possible emergency use. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on Highway 95 for 26 miles to State Road 276. Turn right (south) towards Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell. Follow State Road 276 south until mile marker 32 and a dirt road on the east (left) side of the highway (N37° 36' 55\" W110° 43' 13\"). Turn east on the dirt road and follow it for 0.9 miles to a junction (N37° 36' 30\" W110° 42' 23\") turn east (left) at the junction. Shortly after this junction you will cross a wash which may http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/psychod.htm 1/25/2018 Psycho D - Smith Fork Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 require 4 wheel drive to cross. From the junction follow the road for 1.8 miles to a junction (N37° 37' 17\" W110° 40' 49\"). Turn east (right) at the junction and follow the road for 0.6 miles to a junction (N37° 37' 14\" W110° 40' 15\") that is not shown on the USGS topographical map. Turn east (right) at the junction and follow the road for 0.7 miles to a junction (N37° 36' 41\" W110° 39' 39\"). Turn south (right) and follow the spur road (not on topo maps) for 0.5 miles to where it joins with the same road. At this junction continue ahead (right) for 0.6 miles and turn south (right) following another spur road (not on topo maps). Continue on this spur for 0.3 miles to where it joins with the same road. At this junction stay right and drive 0.1 miles to the trailhead (N37° 35' 58\" W110° 38' 59\") and find an open area to park. Condition of the dirt road varies. 4 wheel drive vehicles will have no problem accessing this trailhead. Carefully driven High clearance vehicles should be able to reach this trailhead in normal conditions. From Lake Powell: This slot canyon is accessible from Lake Powell, just boat to the end of Smith Fork and enjoy the slot. Route Information: From the Psycho D Trailhead (N37° 35' 58\" W110° 38' 59\"), hike east staying on the north side of a developing drainage out to a point (N37° 36' 08\" W110° 38' 26\"). Route find your way down slickrock and into the main drainage of Smith Fork. Head downstream locating a hiker trail on the east (left) side of the canyon that will take you out of the bushy drainage bottom. Soon you will see a hiker tail (N37° 36' 01\" W110° 38' 12\"), on the east (left) side that will lead to a slickrock nose, which allows you to escape the Smith Fork drainage bottom. This is also a good place to stash extra water, food or items you do not want to drag through the slot. Remember, you will want a small pack in the slot. Hike east up the slickrock nose with mild exposure and good views of Psycho D and its side drainage directly to your right. You will want to traverse this side drainage and eventually cross it (N37° 36' 12\" W110° 37' 59\") and than head south towards Psycho D. Once near the rim of Psycho D traverse up canyon until you are stopped by a cross joint canyon, which will require you to loop north to get around it. Once around this cross joint route find your way to to the start of Psycho D (N37° 36' 08\" W110° 37' 41\"). Note: You will notice there are two forks that come together slightly up canyon from this entrance. It is possible to hike up the slickrock nose between the two forks and descend the southern fork. This will lengthen the route by approximately one-third. This addendum adds more high stemming to the route. From the entrance to Psycho D you will want to suit up for some mae west and moderate stemming action. Psycho D has a first set of narrows which is a great warm up as you never get higher than approximately 20-feet off the ground with lots of features. It will take approximately 30-60 minutes to complete this first section. Head downstream stemming over potholes and little tight sections. There is no memorable crux, but lots of fun downclimbing and stemming. At the end of the first section is an escape to the north (right). The second set of narrows will take approximately 1 to 2 hours to complete. The second narrows starts mellow and the stemming progressively gets higher and more intense. Near the end of this section you will come to your first silo which is a little awkward to enter but there is a small ledge and features which allow you to cross. Shortly after this silo is the crux silo. When approaching the silo, it seems too tight to go low and you may want to stem high, but taking the low tighter path is how to cross the silo with lower risk. Most canyoneers will fit through this section. Crossing high puts you 50-feet or so off the deck with few features to assist you. Taking the low path by chimneying side-ways diagonally downward towards the silo is how to approach it. This diagonal traverse is made less strenuous by good heal and toe jams due to the canyon width tapering off at that level. At the entrance of the silo, there is a ledge on the right (looking down canyon) for your foot that you must commit to and then move immediately into a stem on http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/psychod.htm 1/25/2018 Psycho D - Smith Fork Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 the opposing side. Study your moves wisely before committing. It would be possible to body belay your partner, reducing the risk. Once across the silo there is an awkward and strenuous transition to the tighter section on the other side. Once established, high stem for a short distance down canyon where you can downclimb towards the pool at the end of the slot. Near the bottom of this downclimb (before entering the pool) the chimney slightly bombay's making the last bit of the downclimb insecure. Right below this small Bombay is a little stance before getting into the pool and finishing the slot canyon. Enjoy the beautiful alcove at the bottom. Retrieve any stashed gear and start hiking back to the trailhead. Before leaving the bottom of Smith Fork, it is possible to hike up canyon and enjoy a scenic walk through some nice narrows. Hike up canyon and explore a little if time permits, you will enjoy what you find.

This slot canyon is part of the Warm Springs Canyon System. Sinusitis is suitable for skilled and experienced canyoneers only. Sinusitis is normally combined with the Warm Springs Loop to create a bigger bang for your buck. General Information: Sinusitis is a technical canyoneering adventure suitable for those who are both physically fit and experienced. The route is rated 4B R II using the Canyon Rating System. Total time for this slot canyon is approximately 4 to 5 hours. The approach will require approximately one hour. You will spend about 30 minutes establishing your exit. The technical section of the canyon will require 1 or 2 hours. The exit will require approximately one hour. Sinusitis is normally combined with a descent of Caliente, which is part of the Warm Springs Loop. To complete Sinusitis you must establish an escape route in the bottom of the main fork of Warm Springs Canyon, and completing Caliente is the most enjoyable way to accomplish the chore. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Lake Powell water level is not a concern as the route is not accessible from the lake. Sinusitis requires complete technical gear. This route requires two ropes. A 30-foot rope is required to rig the exit. A 80-foot rope is required to work through the canyon and is adequate for defeating all obstacles you will encounter. Other technical equipment should include several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, several rapid links, 50-feet of webbing and a prusik system. Wetsuits are advised in cold or wet weather. This canyon has the ability to hold a lot of water. Expect to find waist to chest deep wading and perhaps a swim. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" and \"Knowles Canyon\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. There are no trails in the area and route finding skills are required. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. Check the local weather report before committing. Trailhead Information: Warm Springs does not require a vehicle shuttle. Four wheel drive is required to access this trailhead. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Not all roads described are noted on the USGS map. From Ticaboo drive north on Highway 276 for 2.0 miles. Turn east (right) on a dirt road (N37° 41' 50\", W110° 40' 16\"). Follow the dirt road for 5.3 miles to a junction (N37° 40' 46\", W110° 36' 15\"). Turn north (left) and follow the dirt road for 1.6 miles to a junction at a big U in the road (N37° 41' 43\", W110° 35' 03\"). Turn south (right) and follow the road for 0.1 miles to a fork (N37° 41' 37\", W110° 35' 06\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 3.5 miles to a http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sinusitis.htm 1/25/2018 Sinusitis - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 second fork (N37° 39' 02\", W110° 36' 15\"). Take the south (left) fork and follow the road for 1.1 miles to the Warm Springs Loop Trailhead. Route Information: From the Warm Springs Loop Trailhead (N37° 38' 09\" W110° 35' 59\"), hike cross- country, for approximately 1 mile in a southwest direction until you reach a break in the rim which allows you to route find to a slickrock bench (N37° 37' 31\" W110° 36' 29\"). Traverse this bench in a southwest direction for a short distance to where you have nice views into Warm Springs, and Lake Powell (N37° 37' 26\" W110° 36' 33\"). Continue hiking down slickrock to the start of a short tributary slot of Warm Springs. This tributary is sometimes referred to as \"Caliente\" (N37° 37' 21\" W110° 36' 39\"). At the head of Caliente you have two options. You can descend Caliente or you can do a walk- around. Option #1: From the top of Caliente head downstream stemming and squeezing your way through the slot. Playing through the short tributary slot should take approximately one hour or less. The route contains lots of sideways shuffling. Soon the Caliente joins the main fork of Warm Springs Canyon. Option #2: Walk around Caliente to the south and route find your way down to the confluence of Caliente and the main fork of Warm Springs Canyon. From the confluence of Warm Springs and Caliente (N37° 37' 08\" W110° 36' 57\"), hike downstream for a short ways enjoying the beautiful sandstone narrows until stopped by a 25-foot dryfall. This is where you want to set up your escape. Hang your 30-foot rope to create a handline. Your escape will be easier if you tie 3 or 4 large loops in your rope to help surmount the top chokestone. After you have established your escape hike the short distance back to the confluence of Caliente and the main fork of Warm Springs Canyon. From the confluence hike out of the canyon to the east using a sandstone ramp. Route find your way east, cross a shallow drainage, and descend to the head of Sinusitis (N37° 37' 08\" W110° 36' 33\"). The first section of Sinusitis contains easy downclimbing that might require a couple of partner assists. After 15 minutes you will encounter a big keeper pothole that you will rappel into. The rappel is 40-feet and anchored from a chokestone. The best way to defeat the big keeper pothole is to rappel in and partner assist out. If the water is at certain levels a partner assist could be difficult. If that is the case you will need to do a pack toss before entering the pothole to establish a handline that will allow you to escape out the downstream side. Once past the big keeper pothole continue downstream. You will encounter several more potholes that will yield to a partner assist or pack toss. In a few places the canyon tightens, but you can always easily stem up and over these obstacles. Near the end of the Sinusitis it looks like a difficult downclimb into the main fork of Warm Springs, but once established (easy) on the downclimb it is very secure. It is recommended to bunny strap your packs or have a body anchor for everyone but the last person. It is a really neat downclimb. Head downstream for 50-feet and visit the huge drop into Lake Powell. Return up Warm Springs Canyon with several partner assists to get over the dryfalls. Once you reach the confluence of Caliente and the main fork of Warm Springs Canyon you can either ascend Caliente or take the recommended exit up the main fork of Warm Springs Canyon. If continuing up Warm Springs you will be stopped by a 20-foot dryfall that you must climb to escape. Send your best climber up first who can then belay everyone else up. You will stem 10- http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sinusitis.htm 1/25/2018 Sinusitis - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 15 feet to a stance beneath a chokestone. Look for holds to the right of the chokestone and surmount the obstacle. Although the moves are fairly easy, you wouldn't want to fall here. Continue upstream with numerous little upclimbs. Soon the canyon will start to open and there is a weakness in the east (right) wall (N37° 37' 33\" W110° 37' 05\"), which allows you to escape to the east rim. Once on the rim hike cross-country, in a northeast direction, for approximately 1 1/4 miles back to the Warm Springs Loop Trailhead. Ethics: There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors which is moderately difficult in this canyon.

This slot canyon is part of the Warm Springs Canyon System. Tinnitus is suitable for skilled and experienced canyoneers only. General Information: Tinnitus is a technical canyoneering adventure suitable for those who are both physically fit and experienced. The route is rated 4B R II using the Canyon Rating System. Total time for this slot canyon is approximately 4 to 5 hours. The approach will require approximately one hour. You will spend about 30 minutes establishing your exit.

This canyon has the ability to hold a lot of water. Expect to find waist to chest deep wading and perhaps a swim. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Lake Powell water level is not a concern as the route is not accessible from the lake. Tinnitus requires complete technical gear. This route requires three ropes. A 60-meter (200-foot) rope is required to rig the exit. A 70-foot rope is required to rig the entrance rappel, A 100-foot rope is required to work through the canyon and is adequate for defeating all obstacles you will encounter. Other technical equipment should include several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, several rapid links, 50-feet of webbing and a prusik system (preferably some nice handled ascenders). This route also requires a #2 and #3 C4 Black Diamond Camalot to establish the entrance rappel, or be prepared to build an anchor with the understanding there is very little material to work with. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" and \"Knowles Canyon\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum.

Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors which is moderately difficult in this canyon. Warning: If you attempt this canyon, every member of your group must be an experienced canyoneer and mediocre rock climber. The most difficult part of this route is the exit which requires a 200-foot free air jug out. This canyon is deadly for beginners or those that overestimate their abilities. For those with the required skills this is a fun and moderate adventure. Errors in technique or judgment will likely have serious consequences. Do not underestimate the difficulty and danger of descending this canyon. A rescue in this canyon would be hazardous and extremely troublesome. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/tinnitus.htm 1/25/2018 Tinnitus - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Trailhead Information: Tinnitus does not require a vehicle shuttle. The canyon is not accessible from Lake Powell and must be reached by four wheel drive. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Not all roads described are noted on the USGS maps. From Ticaboo drive north on Highway 276 for 2.0 miles. Turn east (right) on a dirt road (N37° 41' 50\", W110° 40' 16\"). Follow the dirt road for 5.3 miles to a junction (N37° 40' 46\", W110° 36' 15\"). Turn north (left) and follow the dirt road for 1.6 miles to a junction at a big U in the road (N37° 41' 43\", W110° 35' 03\"). Turn south (right) and follow the road for 0.1 miles to a fork (N37° 41' 37\", W110° 35' 06\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 3.5 miles to a second fork (N37° 39' 02\", W110° 36' 15\"). Take the south (left) fork and follow the road for 1.8 miles to the Tinnitus Trailhead. The trailhead makes for a nice campsite as it is in a low area that is out of the wind and contains a fire ring. Route Information: From the Tinnitus Trailhead (N37° 37' 37\" W110° 35' 33\"), hike south, cross-country, until you reach the rim and a good walk-down through the upper cliff band (N37° 37' 31\", W110° 35' 35\"). At this point the canyon directly in front of you is Glaucoma. Your target is the next drainage to the south (left). Hike down Glaucoma and look for several places where you can route find over to Tinnitus. The navigation is easy but heading down Glaucoma a ways before route finding over to the Tinnitus drainage yields the best results. The head of Tinnitus (N37° 36' 58\" W110° 36' 12\") is obvious. IMPORTANT - Before descending the technical section you must establish an escape route by hanging a rope that you will climb out on later in the day. To establish this escape route rim walk down the north (right) side of the canyon until you see a break where there is a large cairn anchor (N37° 36' 56\" W110° 36' 20\"). From the large cairn you will need to set up an anchor with a 60-meter (200-foot) rope. Lower a pack over the edge and make sure it touches the bottom. The top of the climb out is low-angle and the bottom of the climb out is free hanging. This is a difficult jug out for those that don't know what they are doing. It might also be wise to place some extra water and your ascending gear inside the pack you lower over the edge to reduce the gear you will need to carry through the slot canyon. After establishing your escape hike back to the head of the technical slot. As you can tell this is a very short canyon, but you should respect it. There is very little natural anchor material at the head of the canyon. You could farm rocks from a great distance and create a cairn for your rappel anchor, but those with a little commonsense will downclimb several feet to where they can rappel from a #2 and #3 C4 Black Diamond Camalot equalized into the pothole below. This simple method requires a 70-foot rope. Leave the 70-foot rope here and easily retrieve your rope and Camelot's on the hike out. The first pothole is deep and you will want to partner assist or pack toss to exit from it. The next two potholes can also be exited with a partner assisted pack toss. The canyon has a little stemming that will require some PG rated up climbing, as the canyon is too narrow to fit through. Everyone can fit by climbing over the top. After the squeeze the canyon briefly opens up before it narrows down for a hard up climb. If you soloed the up climb it would be rated about YDS 5.9, but it's easy to partner assist the up climb and get started. The downclimbing on the other side of the hard up climb receives an R rating for exposure, but it isn't very difficult. After this you will go up and down until several times which isn't very strenuous until you reach the final rappel. The final rappel is anchored from a large chokestone and is 50-feet down a chute. The chute is a very cool feature as you are tunneling through and out. Once at the bottom of the chute you will be able to see the rope you established earlier to create your exit. The bottom part of the jug out is free-hanging before turning into low angle. Hike back to the head of the technical section and retrieve your Camalots and rope before hiking back to the trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/tinnitus.htm 1/25/2018 Tinnitus - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/tinnitus.htm 1/25/2018 012314356 789 \u000eÿ\u00109\u0011\u0011\u0012ÿ\u0013ÿ789 \u000eÿ\u00148\u000e\u000e\u0015ÿ\u0013ÿ\u0016\u0017\u0015\u0017\u0018\u0019 $ÿ&'()*+,)ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ./01'23405'/ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ6+1/5/,ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ7+05/,8ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ90:548ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ;))2<+4=ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ>*2+0)8ÿ- ?@ABCDEFÿHAIIJ ?@ABCMN DLEFNOÿPK@FFLÿ ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿRSTUVWXYÿZT[[\\ÿTSYÿTÿ\\V]SXÿT^_ÿ̀^XYSY\\X̀^aÿ_b̀YS\\`]^ÿX]ÿTÿcd^ÿ_Y\\YSXÿ]T\\`\\eÿRV`\\ÿXSf̀ÿ̀\\ÿ\\dX̀Tg[Yÿc]S T[[ÿcTh`[WÿhYhgYS\\e iFOF@AIÿjOkl@mAENlOn ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿRSTUVWXYÿZT[[\\ÿTÿSYÿTÿaSYTXÿVòYÿc]SÿXV]\\Yÿ[]]o`^aÿX]ÿ\\fY^_ÿT^ÿV]dSÿpX̀VÿcSỲ^_\\ÿT^_ÿcTh`[Wÿ̀^ÿT _Y\\YSXÿpTXYSfTSoeÿRVYÿS]dXYÿ̀\\ÿ\\dX̀Tg[Yÿc]SÿT[[ÿcTh`[WÿhYhgYS\\ÿT\\ÿXVYÿVò`^aÿ̀\\ÿ\\V]SXÿpX̀Vÿ^]ÿY[YbTX̀]^ UVT^aYeÿR]XT[ÿX̀hYÿSYqdS̀Y_ÿc]ShÿXST`[VYT_ÿX]ÿXST`[VYT_ÿ̀\\ÿTffS]rh̀TXY[Wÿ]^YÿV]dSeÿRSTUVWXYÿZT[[\\ÿTSY STXY_ÿstÿuÿd\\`^aÿXVYÿvT^W]^ÿwTX̀^aÿxW\\XYheÿRVYÿUT^W]^ÿ̀\\ÿYT\\`[WÿTUUY\\\\g̀[YÿWYTSÿS]d^_e ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿyTbàTX̀]^ÿc]SÿXV`\\ÿS]dXYÿ̀\\ÿYT\\WeÿRVYSYÿ̀\\ÿ^]ÿY\\XTg[`\\VY_ÿXST`[ÿgdXÿW]dÿ\\h̀f[Wÿc][[]pÿXVYÿ\\XSYTheÿz {|xÿ̀\\ÿd\\Ycd[eÿ{]]_ÿhTfÿSYT_`^aÿ\\o`[[\\ÿT^_ÿXVYÿ}x{xÿ~eÿTfÿX̀X[Y_ÿt[TUoÿRTg[YÿTSYÿ^ÙYÿX]ÿVTbY T[]^aeÿz[[ÿpTWf]`^X\\ÿT^_ÿhTf\\ÿc]SÿRSTUVWXYÿZT[[\\ÿd\\YÿXVYÿ{xÿ_TXdhe ANFOAEF@ÿ?@ANICFAn ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿZS]hÿXVYÿ}XTVÿX]p^ÿÿ]cÿT^o\\b`[[Yÿ_Sb̀Yÿ\\]dXVÿ]^ÿVàVpTWÿÿc]Sÿÿh`[Y\\ÿX]ÿXVYÿ\\à^Y_ÿXdS^]cc X]ÿxXTXYÿw]T_ÿ~ÿT^_ÿtd[[cS]aÿTS`^Tÿ]^ÿToYÿ|]pY[[eÿZ][[]pÿxXTXYÿw]T_ÿ~ÿ\\]dXVÿc]Sÿd\\Xÿ]bYSÿ h`[Y\\ÿX]ÿh`[YÿhTSoYSÿeeÿRVYSYÿ̀\\ÿTÿ\\hT[[ÿ\\fdSÿS]T_ÿd\\XÿgYc]SYÿXVYÿgS`_aYÿ]bYSÿRSTUVWXYÿvSYYoÿ]^ÿXVY YT\\Xÿ\\`_Yÿ]cÿXVYÿVàVpTWeÿRVYÿ\\fdSÿS]T_ÿ[YT_\\ÿ_]p^ÿX]ÿXVYÿUSYYoÿT^_ÿfS]b`_Y\\ÿTgd^_T^XÿfTSo`^aeÿRV`\\ÿ̀\\ T[\\]ÿXVYÿXST`[VYT_ÿc]SÿXV`\\ÿ\\V]SXÿVòYe ?@ABCDEFÿHAIIJÿlEFÿjOkl@mAENlOnÿ ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿZS]hÿXVYÿRSTUVWXYÿZT[[\\ÿRST`[VYT_ÿy~ÿ~ÿÿssÿÿÿd\\Xÿc][[]pÿXVYÿ\\XSYThÿYT\\Xÿc]S TffS]rh̀TXY[Wÿsÿh`[YÿX]ÿpVYSYÿXVYÿ\\XSYThÿ_S]f\\ÿXVS]daVÿTÿ[TWYSÿ]cÿ\\T^_\\X]^YÿT^_ÿUSYTXY\\ÿRSTUVWXY ZT[[\\ÿy~ÿ~ÿÿssÿÿ~eÿx]hYX̀hY\\ÿXVYSYÿ̀\\ÿ^]ÿpTXYSÿb`\\g̀[YÿpVYSYÿXVYÿ\\XSYThÿc[]p\\ÿd^_YS XVYÿgS`_aYÿgdXÿ̀Xÿd\\dT[[WÿSYYhYSaY\\ÿgYc]SYÿXVYÿcT[[\\ÿpVY^ÿXVYÿpTXYSÿc[]p`^aÿd^_YSaS]d^_ÿSYTUVY\\ÿXVY \\ThYÿ\\T^_\\X]^Yÿ[TWYSÿXVTXÿUSYTXY\\ÿRSTUVWXYÿZT[[\\eÿ^]Wÿ\\f[T\\V`^aÿ̀^ÿXVYÿpTXYSÿgYc]SYÿSYXdS^`^aÿXVYÿpTW W]dÿUThYe iÿADlNOEJnÿ RSTUVWXYÿZT[[\\ÿRST`[VYT_ÿÿy~ÿ~ÿÿssÿÿÿ RSTUVWXYÿZT[[\\ÿÿy~ÿ~ÿÿssÿÿ~ $ÿ&'()*+,)ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ./01'23405'/ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ6+1/5/,ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ7+05/,8ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ90:548ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ;))2<+4=ÿ-ÿÿÿ$ÿ>*2+0)8ÿ- ÿ'*15,:0ÿ¡¢¢¢£¡¢¤¥¦ÿ§5(<£>0+:4̈'( \u001a\u001b11 \u0011\u0017 \u0013 9 ! 1\"! \u000e\u0011\u0011189 \u000e#9\u0011\u0011\u0012 515 Warm Springs Loop - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Warm Springs Loop aka: Caliente, Fun Slot, Pottymouth Lake Powell Technical Canyoneering Warm Springs Loop is a fun moderate route for experienced canyoneers located on Lake Powell. The canyon is not accessible from the lake and must be reached by four wheel drive. The name Warm Springs was given to the canyon by early prospectors. Before Lake Powell was filled there was a small year round stream that flowed out of the bottom of the canyon into the Colorado River. General Information: Warm Springs Loop is a fun technical canyoneering adventure. The route is rated 3A R III using the Canyon Rating System and will require 6 to 8 hours to complete the full meal deal. The canyon is very tight, however if you can't fit you can always go high and climb over the obstacle, which is why the canyon receives a conditional \"R\" rating. Lake Powell water level is not a concern as the route is not accessible from the lake. Warm Springs requires complete technical gear. This route also requires that the group have at least one competent rock climber along if choosing the suggested exit up Warm Springs Canyon. The canyon might require minor wading in normal conditions. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A 60-foot rope is more then adequate for rigging all required rappels. Other technical equipment should include several shoulder length slings, several rapid links, a couple of double length slings and 50-feet of webbing. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Ticaboo Mesa\" and \"Knowles Canyon\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum.

Take the south (left) fork and follow the road for 1.1 miles to the Warm Springs Loop Trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/warmsprings.htm 1/25/2018 Warm Springs Loop - Lake Powell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 Route Information: From the Warm Springs Loop Trailhead (N37° 38' 09\" W110° 35' 59\"), hike cross- country, for approximately 1 mile in a southwest direction until you reach a break in the rim which allows you to route find to a slickrock bench (N37° 37' 31\" W110° 36' 29\"). Traverse this bench in a southwest direction for a short distance to where you have nice views into Warm Springs, and Lake Powell (N37° 37' 26\" W110° 36' 33\"). Continue hiking down slickrock to the start of a short tributary slot of Warm Springs. This tributary is sometimes referred to as \"Caliente\" (N37° 37' 21\" W110° 36' 39\"). From the top of Caliente get ready to stem and squeeze your way through the slot. Playing through the short tributary slot should take approximately one hour or less. The route contains lots of sideways shuffling. Soon the slot joins the main fork of Warm Springs Canyon. From the confluence of Warm Springs and Caliente (N37° 37' 08\" W110° 36' 57\"), you can venture downstream for a short ways enjoying the beautiful sandstone narrows until stopped by a 25-foot dryfall. From the top of the dryfall you can rappel from one of the chokestones and make the short journey to Lake Powell or you can return up canyon. If you choose to visit Lake Powell rappel into the canyon bottom and enjoy numerous downclimbs, all of which will have to climb back up on your way back out. It is recommended that you fix a piece of webbing with large loops to assist with surmounting the large chokestone at the top of the dryfall when returning. Also a few strategically placed small rocks will help keep your rope from getting wedged onto the east (left) side of the chokestone. Soon a slot referred to as Sinusitis enters from the east (left) and then the big drop into Lake Powell is encountered. This is a very nice view and might be a good place to eat lunch. When returning you may have to partner assist some of the up climbs. When you reach the 25-foot rappel you can use the rope and climb your way fairly easily to just beneath the chokestone. If you gave yourself 3-4 large loops you shouldn't have much of a problem surmounting the chokestone, but keep in mind it is awkward. Send your best climber up first and they can assist others over this obstacle. Head back up canyon. You can either ascend Caliente or take the recommended exit up the main fork of Warm Springs Canyon. If continuing up Warm Springs you will be stopped by a 20- foot dryfall that you must climb to escape. Send your best climber up first who can then belay everyone else up. You will stem 10-15 feet to a stance beneath a chokestone. Look for holds to the right of the chokestone and surmount the obstacle. Although the moves are fairly easy, you wouldn't want to fall here. Continue upstream with numerous little upclimbs. Soon the canyon will start to open and there is a weakness in the east (right) wall (N37° 37' 33\" W110° 37' 05\"), which allows one to escape to the east rim. Once on the rim hike cross-country, in a northeast direction, for approximately 1 1/4 miles back to the Warm Springs Loop Trailhead. The return hike should take approximately 30 to 45 minutes and your vehicle will be visible for most of the hike back to the trailhead.

Soaking and Hot Tubbing Meadow Hot Spring is a lovely pool in the middle of a pasture. The water is crystal clear. You can easily see 20 feet down to the bottom of the pool. A rope is stretched across the pool so you have something to dangle from as you soak your troubles away. The owner of the hot spring has made numerous improvements, including a nice trail, fence and lining the spring with rocks. Please show respect when visiting this paradise. This is private property and you are a guest. General Information: The water temperature is a balmy 100 degrees which makes it ideal for late spring and early fall soaks. The springs are privately owned, the owner has been generous so far and is allowing access to this spring. Take care of the spring and access will likely continue. This is not a nude bathhouse, anyone caught with their pants down will be prosecuted. This is a family friendly hot spring. Bring plenty of water since soaking in the hot spring can be very dehydrating. Go prepared to take a nice soak and don't forget a towel to dry off. Please no soaps, shampoos or dogs. If you visit the hot springs please consider bringing a large plastic garbage bag and spending several minutes picking up trash and hauling it out. Several minutes of effort before you jump into the hot spring will result in a much more pleasant experience for everyone and hauling out the trash is no big deal since the parking area is literally only several feet away. Because this hot spring is so easy to access it has the problem of attracting \"Joe Six-Pack\" and the rubbish he brings. This is a location, which could remain enchanting for many years with a little help from us all or become trashed in a hurry. Please provide a little extra effort and public service to create an enjoyable place to visit. Trailhead Information: From I-15 in Meadow, Utah, take Exit 158. Follow Main Street south, through the small town of Meadow, for 1.4 miles to a well-maintained gravel road heading west. Follow the gravel road west for 4.9 miles as it pass over the top of I-15 and ends at a large dirt parking area (N38° 52' 00\", W112° 30' 15\"). The parking area is easy to identify with a fence and gate. Route Information: From the parking area just follow the path south for 150-yards to the hot spring.

General Information: Nefertiti Petroglyphs and the Price Meet-Up Panel are two great examples of native American rock art. The panels are conveniently located along the impressive Green River in Gray Canyon. The panels are accessible year round in good weather. A round trip from the town of Green River should take approximately two hours. The Price Meet-Up Panel is a large rock that has a massive face covered with petroglyphs and dominated by two large triangular anthropomorphic (human) figures. Nefertiti is a long panel that runs along a small cliff. The main focus of the panel are several large petroglyphs of animals that I assume to be elk. The remainder of the panel is covered with big horn sheep, a snake and other various animal forms. Navigation for this route is easy. GPS waypoints are provided to assist in easily locating all rock art. There is nothing difficult about the route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Butler Canyon\" shows the area. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: High clearance vehicles, four wheel drives and rental cars should have no problem reaching the trailhead in normal weather conditions. A carefully driven passenger sedan can usually make this trip. From the center of Green River, Utah travel east on Main Street (Utah Highway 191) and cross the bridge over the Green River. After crossing the bridge continue east for 0.5 miles to the signed \"Hastings Road\" on the north (left) side of the highway. Turn north on Hastings Road and follow it for 9.2 miles to where the pavement ends at Swaseys Rapid Boat Ramp (N39° 06' 41\", W110° 06' 32\"). From Swaseys Rapid Boat Ramp continue following the main dirt road north, for 2.8 miles to an old Homestead Cabin (N39° 08' 33\", W110° 06' 02\"). Get out and have a look around, there is a nice picnic area located behind the cabin next to the Green River. From the Cabin continue following the main dirt road north for 3.9 miles to the Price Meet-Up Panel (N39° 10' 49\", W110° 06' 11\"). The panel is named because this is the confluence of the Price River and Green River. The panel is located just up stream from the actual confluence on the east (right) side of the road. The panel is not difficult to locate and is easily visible from the road. From the Price Meet-Up Panel continue following the main dirt road north for 1.9 miles to the Nefertiti Petroglyphs (N39° 11' 37\", W110° 04' 40\"). The panel is named after the monolithic rock that some say looks like Nefertiti located on the west side of the Green River. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/nefertiti.htm 1/25/2018 Nefertiti Petroglyph Panel - Green River Page 2 of 2 The panel is located directly east of Nefertiti Rock on the east (right) side of the road. The panel is not difficult to locate and is easily visible from the road. From the Nefertiti Petroglyphs continue following the main dirt road north for 150-yards to a second panel of petroglyphs (N39° 11' 43\", W110° 04' 37\"). The panel is difficult to see as the figures are small and weather worn. The panel is located on the east (right) side of the road along the small ledges. The panel contains a big horn sheep and snake among other figures. Explore along the rocks in this area and you might find a few more petroglyphs. Please take nothing but pictures and leave nothing but footprints. Camping Information: There is an improved campground at Swaseys Rapid (end of pavement) and several excellent primitive campgrounds located along the remainder of the route. River Running Information: The route from Nefertiti to Swaseys Rapid in known as the \"Green River Daily\" and is a popular whitewater rafting route. There are boat ramps and vault toilets at both Swaseys Rapid and Nefertiti. Rock Art Information: Although it is difficult to establish an exact age of rock art, some dating clues are easily identified. For example, whenever a horse and rider is depicted, we know the date to be after A.D. 1540 when the Spaniards reintroduced the horse to the New World. The presence of bows and arrows is presumed to indicate a date after A.D. 500, the generally accepted time period for their appearance in this region. Anasazi - AD 1 to AD 1275 A variety of human forms (Anthropomorphic) with earrings, headdresses, handprints, paw prints, birds, spirals, bighorn sheep, shield-like images, deer, Kokopellis and some abstract designs.

414 Sand Creek Waterfall - Torrey, Utah - Hiking Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Sand Creek Waterfall Torrey, Utah Hiking Sand Creek Waterfall is a rarely visited oasis hidden deep in the redrock cliffs of Hell's Hole, which is located just outside of Capitol Reef National Park. This adventure is a great hike for all healthy adults and older children. The entire family will enjoy this wonderful stroll through the junipers and redrock that ends at a magical waterfall. General Information: The Sand Creek Trail is not difficult and can be completed by any healthy adult or older child in average physical condition. No special gear is required other than footwear suitable for walking over rough ground. The hike involves walking approximately 1 1/2 miles each way over a well maintained trail for all but the final 250-yards. The route has a 560-foot elevation gain and will require approximately two or three hours round trip to complete. The route is rated 1A I using the canyon rating system. While there is shade along the route the heat would be brutal on a hot summer day. During hot weather an early morning or evening hike is recommended. Every member of your hiking party should carry at least one liter of water. This hike should be easily accessible year round. Navigation for this hike is moderate. The route is easy to follow, but a GPS or really good map reading skills will be required to locate the actual waterfall as it is hidden off the trail. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Torrey\" covers this hike. Trailhead Information: A high clearance 4x4 is required to access the Sand Creek Trailhead. A high clearance 2WD vehicle will get you to within about 1 mile of the trailhead. In other words, those with a 4x4 get to do a little less walking. A shuttle vehicle is not required for this route. There are numerous primitive campsites along the approach road, but much of this area is open to ATV's so take that into consideration if camping. The area is criss-crossed with roads and ATV trails, stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. The Sand Creek Trailhead is located along FR207, some of the junctions will be signed FR207 and some are not, this little bit of information can make reaching the trailhead a little easier as you just follow the FR207 signs when they appear. From Center and Main in Torrey, Utah drive west on State Road 24 for 0.7 miles. Turn north (right) on Sand Creek Road (N38° 17' 56\", W111° 25' 56\"), which is signed Great Western Trail. Drive 0.7 miles and turn west (left) to a kiosk (N38° 18' 38\", W111° 25' 59\"). From the kiosk follow FR146 northwest for 0.8 miles to a junction (N38° 19' 06\", W111° 26' 33\"), Take the west (Left) fork and drive 0.8 miles to a junction (N38° 19' 27\", W111° 27' 22\"). Take the north (right) fork, signed FR207, and drive 0.8 miles to a junction (N38° 20' 02\", W111° 27' 27\"). Take the north (left) fork and drive 1.7 miles to the Sand Creek Trailhead. The trailhead is identified by a Great Western Trail sign giving mileage and additional signs blocking the Sand Creek Trail stating \"No ATV's\". Route Information: From the Sand Creek Trailhead (N38° 21' 20\", W111° 28' 02\"), follow the trail signed \"No http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sandcreek.htm 1/25/2018 Sand Creek Waterfall - Torrey, Utah - Hiking Page 2 of 2 ATV's\" as it crosses to the east side of Sand Creek and begins following an old 4x4 road north. After crossing the creek the route always stays on the east side of the creek. At times the trail remains near the creek and at other times it meanders away for a considerable distance. After hiking for 1 1/4 miles from the trailhead the track will climb a steep hill and head northeast, away from the creek. As you near the top of the hill you will see a faint game trail heading northwest (N38° 22' 16\", W111° 27' 44\"). Occasionally this junction is marked with a small cairn (stack of rocks). Follow the faint game tail to the northwest and listen for the waterfall. The waterfall is locate 250-yards off the track at the north end of the easily visible cliffs (N38° 22' 19\", W111° 27' 49\"). The easiest method of locating the waterfall is to follow the sound, which should lead you to two large redrock boulders. You can stand on top of the boulders and enjoy a magnificent view looking down at the waterfall. Scramble down to the base of the waterfall around the north side of the boulders.

The petroglyphs are interesting because they depict tropical and oceanic images. No trip to Story Rock is complete without spending a few minutes in the Iosepa Cemetery learning the history of the people that carved the images and settled the town. General Information: Story Rock Petroglyphs consist of a large rock covered with Polynesian petroglyphs. Story Rock is accessible year round in good weather. Spring, winter and fall are the ideal times for this hike. The route can be miserably hot in summer. The route is one mile each way and contains 700 feet of elevation gain. A round trip hike to visit Story Rock requires 2 or 3 hours, depending on how much exploring you do while in the area and how much time you spend in the cemetery learning the history of Iosepa. Every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of one liter of water. A GPS is required to locate the Story Rock Petroglyphs. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Salt Mountain \" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate and there is no trail. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Story Rock Petroglyphs are rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: From Salt Lake City take I-80 west and drive 43 miles to the Rowley/Dugway Exit #77. Turn south (left) and follow the Skull Valley Road for 13.8 miles to mile marker 22.9 and a well- maintained gravel road on the east (left) side of the highway. Follow the gravel road 100-feet, through the gate to a Tee, turn south (right) and follow the gravel road for 1.0 miles to the Iosepa Cemetery. This is the trailhead for Story Rock. The trailhead is easy to identify as the cemetery is maintained and has a large covered pavilion next to it that hosts Polynesian cultural events. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: From the Iosepa Cemetery Trailhead (N40° 32' 31\", W112° 44' 01\"), Follow the well defined trail that leads east, up the hill behind the covered pavilion. The trail will pretty much disappear after reaching the crest of the first hill. Occasionally you will be able to follow a faint use trail on the way to Story Rock. From the trailhead you must hike one mile east to locate Story Rock (N40° 32' 32\", W112° 43' 09\"). The rock is located is a small valley on the last plateau before climbing towards the summit ridge. Story Rock is not visible from the Iosepa Cemetery. Iosepa History: Iosepa was established in Skull Valley in 1889 as a community for Hawaiian members of the Mormon faith who wished to immigrate to Utah to be close to the temples and headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Iosepa lasted as a community until 1917 at which time the residents returned to Hawaii where the Hawaiian LDS Temple was under construction. The LDS Church paid the travel expenses for those who could not afford to pay themselves. Iosepa (pronounced \"Yo-see-pa\"), meaning Joseph in Hawaiian was named after the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/storyrock.htm 1/25/2018 Story Rock - Hawaiian Petroglyphs & Iosepa Ghost Town Page 2 of 2 Mormon prophet Joseph Smith. The colony was undertaken as a joint stock company incorporated as the Iosepa Agriculture and Stock Company. The LDS Church actually owned the company although individuals subscribed for the stock and held it in trust for the church. The first group of forty-six settlers arrived on 28 August 1889 and drew lots for the land they were to occupy. Additional settlers arrived, built houses, a schoolhouse, a general store, and an irrigation system which drew water from the Stansbury Mountains to water a variety of crops including beets, wheat, oats, barley, corn, potatoes, and squash. By 1901 the population stood at about 80 and reached 228 by 1915. A majority of the residents were Hawaiians, but other island groups were represented as well. The Polynesians raised pigs and fished in local ponds to supplement the crops they grew. A few Anglos resided in the town, working as supervisors on the Skull Valley farm. Most residents worked small farms or were employed by the Mormon Church farm in Skull Valley. The colony was not self-sustaining and LDS Church leaders were forced to allocate church funds to cover expenses. Following a series of crop failures, many of the men began to work in the gold and silver mines which prospered in the nearby mountains during the late 1890s. In addition to economic difficulties, there were other problems for the settlement. In 1896 three cases of leprosy were discovered and the victims were isolated in a special house, although fears of the spread of leprosy were unfounded. The harsh environment--burning heat in the summer and extreme cold in the winter--took its toll on the settlers, as witnessed by the large number of graves in the cemetery. When the Hawaiian Mormons left Iosepa for Hawaii, many of them settled on the church plantation at Laie, Oahu. Iosepa was sold in 1917 to a livestock company. The cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

The petroglyphs have been chipped and etched into the rock. The petroglyph was probability created by the Timpanogos Ute Indians that once inhabited the Utah and Cedar Valley. I'm really not sure how long this panel will last as civilization and the nearby suburbs will probably soon over run the petroglyph and cause it's destruction, so enjoy it while you can. General Information: Northern Utah Rock Art is not nearly as abundant as in other parts of the state. What makes this panel fun is that its within easy reach of the major population centers of Utah. The panel also allows you to brush up on your Pony Express history. The petroglyph is accessible year round. The Three Warriors Petroglyph is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. A round trip hike to visit the petroglyph will require approximately 30 minutes. Access is simple and only requires hiking 100-yards across a field. A GPS might be helpful in locating the petroglyph. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Cedar Fort\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy, but there is no defined trail. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: From Redwood Road and 8570 North in Saratoga Springs (known as the Crossroads), head south on Redwood Road for 1.8 miles to Pony Express Parkway. Turn west (right) on Pony Express Parkway and follow it for 5.2 miles to the signed Pony Express Viewpoint located on the west (right) side of the road. The viewpoint is the trailhead and consists of a paved parking area and several information kiosks. Route Information: From the Pony Express Viewpoint (N40° 20' 50\", W112° 00' 18\"), look west across the highway to the obvious rock outcropping on the far side of the field 100-yards away. The Three Warriors Panel (N40° 20' 52\", W112° 00' 05\") is located on the large rock at the eastern edge of the outcropping. Use caution when crossing the highway and hike across the field to the rock art. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. Pony Express History: The first Pony Express rider took off from St. Joseph, Missouri, with his bags of mail on April 3, 1860 heading for Sacramento California. The mail system was established to create faster communication with California. Riders braved dangerous terrain to deliver letters that were written on tissue paper wrapped in oil paper. At first, people paid a monstrous $5 to mail a letter weighing half an ounce or less; that was later reduced to $2.50. It took 9 to 11 days for express riders to get from St. Joseph to Sacramento. Each express rider was required to cover a run of about 100 miles. Attached to his saddle were two pouches, weighing around 20 pounds. There were about 80 riders and 400 to 500 horses on the express. In the early days, riders would have to cover about 25 miles between stations. When that proved to be too far for the horses, stations were placed about 10 miles apart. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/threewarrior.htm 1/25/2018 Three Warriors Petroglyph - Eagle Mountain Page 2 of 2 Sometimes the express rider would arrive at his station to find that the man who should take his place had been “killed and disabled” or the entire station was “wiped out by Indians.” In that case the rider had to continue on, withstanding the fatigue. The longest run of 322 miles is credited to the most famous express man, Buffalo Bill Cody. With the completion of the Pacific Telegraph line, the Pony Express ceased operation on October 24, 1861, having never succeeded financially. But for an enterprise that lasted a mere 19 months, the Pony Express lives on in the imagination and hearts of many Americans..

Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] The Tunnel Arches National Park Hiking Looking for something unique in Arches National Park that is not on the standard tourist route? The Tunnel is a highly unusual natural feature that is seldom visited. The route is easy to follow and requires only a couple of hours. General Information: The Tunnel is a wonderful desert hike that will require 2 or 3 hours round trip. The route is 1 3/4 miles each way along a stream and across flat desert. Elevation gain on this hike is virtually nil. This route should be easy for any experienced hiker. In normal conditions, with a little care and commonsense, you can complete this route with dry shoes. All others might find ankle to knee deep wading along the route. This route combines nicely with Ring Arch. The Tunnel requires you carry a least enough water for half-a-day in the desert, depending on current conditions. Beginners will find a 60-foot section of rope helpful as a handline if they wish to access and crawl through the arch. A flashlight or headlamp is not required. Navigation for this route is moderate. There is no trail for most of the way but the route follows the bottom of two washes so it is not difficult to follow. Paying attention to your map and route description is required. Mistakes in navigation are easy to overcome and correct on this route. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"The Windows Section\" are helpful. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. This route is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Follow the route described and you will avoid areas of cryptobiotic crust. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy decades of growth! The Tunnel Facts: The Tunnel was first reported and recorded by Reuben Scolnik in May 1979. The Tunnel is a highly unusual feature. The opening is about 4 feet wide, 5 feet high, and the tunnel is 53 feet long. Once inside The Tunnel you can see that water seeping between two rock layers played a major role in its formation. Trailhead Information: From Arches National Park Visitor Center drive into the park for 4.4 miles to the bridge over Courthouse Wash. Park at the large, paved, pull-out on the north (left) side of the road, just east of the bridge. This is the Courthouse Wash Trailhead. The trailhead easily accommodates several vehicles. There is no restroom at the trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: From the Courthouse Wash Trailhead (N38° 38' 58\", W109° 35' 54\"), follow the well- traveled use trail that leads directly west toward the massive sandstone buttress. The use trail is almost a direct path along the north side of Courthouse Wash. Once the trail reaches the massive sandstone buttress is drops down and follows along the stream in Courthouse Wash. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/tunnel.htm 1/25/2018 The Tunnel - Arches National Park - Hiking Page 2 of 2 The trail soon disappears, but just keep following the stream up river. 1 mile after leaving the trailhead you will notice a major drainage (N38° 39' 08\", W109° 36' 44\") entering from the north (right) that leads to \"The Tunnel\". Follow this major side drainage northeast for 3/4 miles. You will eventually encounter a massive sandstone buttress with a large toadstool looking rock formation (N38° 39' 34\", W109° 36' 26\") guarding it's nose. The north entrance to the The Tunnel is directly behind the toadstool shaped rock formation. The Tunnel is easiest to access from the North Portal. You can friction up the slickrock to a wide, flat, platform at the opening of this strange arch. With a little partner assist everyone should be able to climb up and crawl through The Tunnel. Video: Enjoy a short video of \"The Tunnel\" combined with a technical descent of \"Big Horn Canyon\" in Arches National Park.

As with most of the Moab area canyons the route is more of an entertaining circuit. But the adventure makes up for its lack of a long swirling slot canyon by visiting a unique natural feature known as \"The Tunnel\" and providing a technical challenge to some breath-taking scenery. General Information: Big Horn is best described as a fun hiking route with a short technical section of canyon. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 4 hours. Big Horn requires complete technical gear. The scenery is dramatic. Big Horn is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. You will need an Arches Canyoneering Permit to enter Big Horn Canyon. This route combines nicely with a visit to Ring Arch for those wanting a full day. In normal conditions the route should be dry. There are several rappels in the canyon with the highest being 55-feet. Because of the long rope pulls required to reach useable natural anchors, two 60-meter ropes and a minimum of 100-feet of webbing are required; the innovative might be able to get by with less. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"The Windows Section\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Big Horn use the WGS84 datum. This route has an extremely minor flash flood danger. Trailhead Information: From Arches National Park Visitor Center drive into the park for 4.4 miles to the bridge over Courthouse Wash. Park at the large, paved, pull-out on the north (left) side of the road, just east of the bridge. This is the Courthouse Wash Trailhead. The trailhead easily accommodates several vehicles. There is no restroom at the trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: From the Courthouse Wash Trailhead (N38° 38' 58\", W109° 35' 54\"), follow the well- traveled use trail that leads directly west toward the massive sandstone buttress. The use trail is almost a direct path along the north side of Courthouse Wash. Once the trail reaches the massive sandstone buttress it drops down and follows along the stream in Courthouse Wash. The trail soon disappears, but continue upstream. One mile after leaving the trailhead you will notice a major drainage (N38° 39' 08\", W109° 36' 44\") entering from the north (right) that leads to \"The Tunnel\". Follow this major side drainage northeast for 3/4 miles. You will eventually encounter a massive sandstone buttress with a large toadstool-looking rock formation (N38° 39' 34\", W109° 36' 26\") guarding its nose. The north entrance to The Tunnel is directly behind the toadstool-shaped rock formation. The Tunnel is easiest to access from the North Portal. You can friction up the slickrock to a wide, flat, platform at the opening of this strange arch. With a little partner assist everyone should be able to climb up and crawl through The Tunnel. After exiting The Tunnel you must climb through the cliff bands directly east using the obvious weakness at the center. After reaching the top of the cliff bands, hike east towards the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bighorn.htm 1/25/2018 Big Horn - Arches National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 interesting rock formation (N38° 39' 38\", W109° 35' 54\") forming the highest point in the area. From the rock formation continue 1/4 mile east to the head of Big Horn (N38° 39' 41\", W109° 35' 40\"). There are many short slots draining the Great Wall. Big Horn is identified by the lone cedar tree at its head. You can actually downclimb this smooth round bottom canyon for most it's length. But you will probably want to sling the lone cedar tree so you have a handline and a rope for a couple of small drops near the bottom of the canyon. It's your call, just be warned the difficulties stiffen up the closer you get to the bottom. After descending the smooth round bottom section of canyon, you are presented with a nice hanging garden. The downstream side of the hanging garden is protected by an overhanging 55-foot free air rappel. The rappel is anchored from several boulders at the lip of the dryfall. It was also in this hanging garden where we found the remains of a Big Horn sheep that had reached this point and could not escape. After the overhanging rappel, walk downstream and exit stage left (east). Walk the bench until you find a place to set a simple 10-foot rappel over the last obstacle; if you are lucky you might find a place to downclimb this obstacle. Pick a wash to avoid the cryptobiotic crust and follow it to the highway (N38° 39' 42\", W109° 35' 18\"). This is also the trailhead for the popular Dragonfly Canyon. From the highway it's a short stroll back to the Courthouse Wash Trailhead. Cryptobiotic Soil: Follow the route described and you will avoid areas of cryptobiotic crust. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth. Video: Enjoy a short video from Big Horn in Arches National Park. Full Meal Deal: It would be easy to combine Big Horn and Dragonfly Canyon into a daylong adventure. If attempting the Full Meal Deal I would suggest starting at the Courthouse Wash Trailhead and doing Big Horn first. This will put all the major hiking in the cool morning and the wet potholes in the warm afternoon. If completing the full meal deal, just hike up Courthouse Wash to the Big Horn Trailhead at the end of the day.

As with most of the area canyons the actual slot is short, but the canyon makes up for its limited technical challenge by providing entertaining arches and a nice selection of native American rock art. General Information: Cameltoe is best described as a fun hiking route with a short section of slot canyon. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 4 hours. Cameltoe requires complete technical gear. The scenery is dramatic. Cameltoe is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. In normal conditions this route contains little or no flowing water. The route does contain one waist deep wade that is approximately 20-feet long. Wetsuits are not used on this route. Standard procedure is to strip down to you underwear, drybag your clothes, blast quickly through the water and redress on the other side. This method is used for all weather conditions that require keeping your clothes dry. The route does not normally consist of flowing water, but it is possible to encounter flow during certain times of the year. If the canyon is flowing consider yourself blessed. The only required rappel in the canyon is 48-feet. A 100-foot rope is required to complete the route. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Gold Bar Canyon\" and \"Moab\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Cameltoe use the WGS84 datum. This route has an extremely minor flash flood danger. Trailhead Information: From Moab head north out of town on U.S. Highway 191. Cross the bridge over the Colorado River. After crossing the bridge continue north for 1.3 miles to the signed \"Potash\" road, which is State Road 279. Turn west (left) and follow State Road 279 for 10.1 miles to the signed Corona Arch trailhead. The trailhead is located on the north (right) side of the road. The trailhead consists of a large gravel parking lot and an information kiosk. Gold Bar Campground is located across the road from the trailhead, next to the Colorado River. For more information or for reservations, please call the Bureau of Land Management Moab Field Office at (435) 259-2100. Route Information: From the Corona Arch Trailhead (N38° 34' 28\", W109° 37' 57\"), follow the trail as it climbs east to a BLM register located on a small bench where you intersect the railroad tracks. At this point do not continue to follow the Corona Arch Trail, but instead follow the railroad tracks northwest (left). Hike 1/3 mile along the railroad tracks until you encounter a passageway through the fence that borders the tracks. Next to the fence passageway are half a dozen large boulders that contain numerous petroglyphs (N38° 34' 45\", W109° 38' 05\"). The petroglyphs are abundant, but unfortunately many have been heavily vandalized. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/cameltoe.htm 1/25/2018 Cameltoe - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 The petroglyphs are located on a wide bench above the canyon bottom and below the cliffs. From the petroglyphs hike north along the bench. Eventually a nice hiker trail begins to develop along the bench that makes hiking easy. Along this bench trail you will encounter several natural arches if you look for them. Approximately 3/4 miles beyond the petroglyphs the hiker trail veers east (right) into a side canyon. It is at this point where you must climb down to the bottom of the drainage to where the main and side canyon joins (N38° 35' 12\", W109° 37' 54\"). Do not follow the trail and side canyon east, but instead follow the main drainage northwest for 150 yards to a large dryfall (N38° 35' 17\", W109° 38' 00\"). The dryfall is easiest to bypass on the west (left) side. From the top of the dryfall a bench begins to quickly form on the east (right) side of the canyon. Follow this bench north taking the path of least resistance. The bench slowly climbs to a point midway between the canyon bottom and the cliff band. You will soon be treated to a wonderful view looking down on \"The Toe\". From the dryfall you must follow the bench for 3/4 mile to where a natural ramp (N38° 35' 45\", W109° 37' 33\") allows a simple walk down to the canyon bottom. From the top of the ramp if you look west you will have a nice view of Gold Bar Arch, often called Jeep Arch, because it really looks like a Jeep. Hike down the ramp to the canyon bottom. Once in the canyon bottom simply hike downstream. You will pass a little natural bridge and several dryfalls that end in lush grotto's. All the dryfalls can be bypassed on the north (right) side. Approximately 1/2 mile below the ramp you will encounter the signature feature of the route, better known as \"The Toe\" (N38° 35' 34\", W109° 37' 56\"). To pass through the short slot section you must wade a short pool and rappel 48- feet. The rappel anchor consists of two bolts on the south (left) side of the pour-off. After finishing the rappel hike down canyon and enjoy the stroll. Soon enough you will reach the large dryfall you climbed around on the approach. Bypass the dryfall on the west (right) side and continue following the main drainage. You will pass several additional dryfalls with lush grottos on your trip downstream, all of which are bypassed on the east (left) side. When you reach the railroad tracks you can walk underneath them using the culvert. Once through the culvert follow the highway south back to the Corona Arch Trailhead. Optional Route Information: For the exceedingly skilled it is possible to climb to the top of Corona Arch using the Arch Bagging Variation. From the top of Corona Arch cross an extremely exposed ledge leading to the top of Bowtie Arch. From the top of Bowtie Arch circle around the side drainage and enter Cameltoe at the ramp. This route is not for beginners or intermediates. A 60 meter rope might allow for some protection of the extremely exposed sections. Hiking Information: With a bit of wandering hikers can enjoy the complete Cameltoe. The standard route contains only one rappel that can be bypassed with a little extra route finding. The only rule for hikers is don't climb up or down anything you can not reverse.

The entire family will enjoy splashing in the warm fresh water. The Cowboy Hot Tubs are formed where Mill Creek flows over a long section of slickrock. The sun heats the slickrock, which in turn heats the water to bath tub warm temperatures. To top things off native American rock art lines the canyon walls for your enjoyment. General Information: The Cowboy Hot Tubs are a very short hike to a beautiful desert oasis. The route can be enjoyed by any adult or child. No special gear is required. Most groups will want to bring clothing suitable for swimming to maximize the fun. The area is very photogenic and contains several excellent panels of petroglyphs. The hike involves hiking less than 1/2 mile each way, with an elevation gain/loss of approximately 200-feet. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead can range anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. The Cowboy Hot Tubs are rated 1C I using the Canyon Rating System. A GPS is extreme over-kill, but I've included the usual map and waypoints for the navigationally challenged. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Rill Creek\" shows the area. All waypoints and maps for The Cowboy Hot Tubs use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. From Center and Main Street in Moab head south out of town on U.S. Highway 191 (Main Street) for 4.2 miles. Turn left (east) onto Spanish Trail Road. Drive 1.0 miles to the traffic circle, take the 3rd exit onto Murphy Lane. Drive 0.5 miles and turn right onto Cedar Hills Road. Drive 200-feet and turn left onto West Highland Drive. Drive 0.4 miles to an unnamed gravel road (N38° 32' 51\", W109° 29' 41\") on the left (east) side of the road. Follow the gravel road, which immediately turns into a dirt road, for 0.3 miles to the Cowboy Hot Tubs Trailhead. Those in low clearance passenger vehicles will have to walk the last 1/4 mile of dirt road to reach the actual trailhead. Route Information: From the Cowboy Hot Tub Trailhead (N38° 33' 01\", W109° 29' 29\"), follow the trail northeast as it descents to the bottom of Mill Creek Canyon. You will reach the stream in 1/4 mile. Once at the stream begin hiking downstream and you will encounter an excellent petroglyph panel (N38° 33' 13\", W109° 29' 39\") on a prominent rock outcropping on the left (west) side of the canyon. The rock art is easy to see from the trail if you look up about 20-feet. From the petroglyph panel hike downstream about 200-yards and you will reach the first of the Cowboy Hot Tubs (N38° 33' 18\", W109° 29' 45\"). On the canyon wall east of the first of the Cowboy Hot Tub are several excellent petroglyph panels (N38° 33' 17\", W109° 29' 42\"). If you look hard you can actually see them from the first tub. If you hike along the base of the cliff and you will find a lot more rock art. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/cowboyhottub.htm 1/25/2018 Cowboy Hot Tubs - Moab Page 2 of 2 There are numerous tubs, splash pools, and potholes to play in for the next 1/4 mile downstream. The end of the water park fun is marked by a small waterfall into a large pool of water (N38° 33' 25\", W109° 29' 50\"). Video: Enjoy a short video from the Cowboy Hot Tubs.

There is no trail to the actual collection of amazing rock art panels, and the rangers will not tell you where the rock art is located. The petroglyphs are guarded by a simple sign stating \"You've found something unique please preserve it\". General Information: Dark Angel Pictographs contains hundreds of interesting rock art images. The rock art is accessible year round in good weather. Spring, winter and fall are the ideal times for this hike. The route can be very hot in summer. The time required to hike from the Devils Garden Trailhead to the Pictographs without any side excursions is approximately one hour each way. But this trip will require at least 1/2 a day to visit and enjoy the petroglyphs. The route can easily be stretched into a full day adventure if you visit all of the arches along the way. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least two liters of water. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route and in locating the petroglyphs. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Klondike Bluffs\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. The route follows a maintained trail for most of it's length. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Dark Angel Petroglyphs is rated 1A II using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Arches National Park is located five miles north of the town of Moab, Utah. The trailhead for this adventure is located inside Arches NP in a beautiful section of the park known as Devil's Garden. This trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions via a paved road. To get to Devils Garden start at the Arches NP Visitor Center and drive 19 miles into the park to the end of the main road, which is the Devils Garden parking area. There are 150 parking spaces and during peak usage this parking lot fills up. Overflow parking is not allowed. The trailhead is at the end of the main road where it makes a small loop. Arriving early (before 9:00 a.m.) is the easiest method of eliminating any parking hassles. Route Information: From the Devil's Garden Trailhead (N38° 46' 58\", W109° 35' 41\") follow the signed trail northwest for 2 miles to Double O Arch (N38° 47' 59\", W109° 37' 16\"). Along the way you will pass impressive Landscape Arch, and the fallen remains of Wall Arch (Wall Arch fell in 2008). You might also want to enjoy some of the side trails to Tunnel Arch, Pine Tree Arch, Navajo Arch and Partition Arch. Upon reaching Double O Arch the Monolith known as Dark Angel (N38° 48' 05\", W109° 37' 39\") will be visible 1/2 mile to the northwest. Hike the signed trail 1/4 mile towards Dark Angel to where the trail crests a small rise and has a slight bend to the right. This is where you leave the maintained trail (N38° 47' 57\", W109° 37' 30\"). You will know you are in the correct spot if you hike 15-yards west and find yourself standing on top of a 15-foot cliff. Route find to the base of the 15-foot cliff, there are several easy ways if you look around. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/darkangel.htm 1/25/2018 Dark Angel Petroglyphs - Arches National Park Page 2 of 2 Once at the base of the small cliff follow the cliff band northwest for 100-yards to a NPS Register (N38° 47' 58\", W109° 37' 35\"), this register marks the beginning of the petroglyphs. Start scanning the cliff wall and keep following it northwest. After 200-yards you will encounter the largest concentration and finest Pictographs (N38° 48' 02\", W109° 37' 42\"). At this location you will also encounter a sign stating \"You've found something unique please preserve it\". After visiting the rock art you can visit Dark Angel before returning to Double O Arch. Upon reaching Double O Arch you have two choices, you can return on the trail you hiked in on, or you can hike out on the signed \"Primitive Trail\". Personally I like to make a loop hike out of the trip just for a change of scenery. The primitive trail only adds about 30 minutes to the hike out. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

This freak of nature is a natural tunnel through the sandstone. General Information: The Dellenbaugh Tunnel is an oddity of nature that can easily be visited by all family members. A round trip from Moab requires approximately 3 hours. A round trip from the trailhead requires about 20 minutes, which includes walking through the tunnel. Dellenbaugh Tunnel is accessible year provided the roads are in reasonably dry conditions. A headlamp is not required for this adventure. The route is located in a popular area of four wheel drive trails near Moab. The route is suitable for most stock high clearance pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles with four wheel drive. The roads are not hardcore four wheeling, but you will encounter several minor obstacles, which will require careful tire placement. A GPS is useful in verifying you are following the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Dubinky Wash\" shows the area described. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. A stop to visit Intestine Man should be included in this adventure as it is along the same route. Nice primitive camping is available at numerous locations along the route. Trailhead Information: This attraction is located just outside of Moab on the road to Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands Island in the Sky District. From Moab head north out of town on U.S. Highway 191. Cross the bridge over the Colorado River. After crossing the bridge continue north for 8.3 miles to the junction with State Road 313, signed Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands. Turn west (left) on State Road 313 and follow it for 8.5 miles to mile marker 14.0 (N38° 37' 43\", W109° 48' 06\"). Turn north (right) on the unsigned, but well-maintained, Dubinky Well Road. Follow the Dubinky Well Road for 1.5 miles to a signed fork in the road (N38° 38' 33\", W109° 49' 15\"). Take the north (right) fork and continue following the Dubinky Well Road 5.0 miles to a minor junction (N38° 41' 26\", W109° 52' 54\") with a less traveled road heading west (left). This junction is easy to identify as you can easy see the Dubinky Well Windmill out your front window and the junction is signed \"Dripping Spring\". Turn west (left) on the Dripping Spring road and follow it for 2.0 miles to the base of Tombstone (N38° 41' 04\", W109° 55' 00\"). Any high clearance vehicle, and many passenger cars, can reach this point. From here the road becomes a true 4x4 route. You can easily park and walk from Tombstone or anywhere else along the route if driving becomes too rough for your taste. From the base of Tombstone locate a 4x4 route heading south, follow the road for 0.9 miles to a junction in the bottom of a wash (N38° 40' 31\", W109° 55' 20\"). At the junction turn http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/dellenbaugh.htm 1/25/2018 Dellenbaugh Tunnel - Moab Page 2 of 2 west (left) and follow the wash downstream. The road will eventual climb out of the wash bottom and 1.0 miles beyond the wash bottom junction you will reach the Dellenbaugh Tunnel Trailhead (N38° 40' 11\", W109° 55' 47\"). The trailhead is identified by a small sign stating no vehicles beyond this point and pointing the way to the Dellenbaugh Tunnel. Route Information: From the Dellenbaugh Tunnel Trailhead walk west 50-yards and you will locate the entrance to the Dellenbaugh Tunnel (N38° 40' 11\", W109° 55' 51\"). You can easily walk through the tunnel to its exit and a pour-off providing outstanding views into the upper reaches of Spring Canyon. A headlamp is not required as you can see completely through the 75-yard long natural tunnel. Explore the area and return the way you came. Video: Here is a short video of Dellenbaugh Tunnel.

The route visits a beautiful canyon that is hidden from the average tourist. The route is beginner friendly with competent leadership. General Information: Dragonfly Canyon is a fun technical canyoneering adventure that involves potholes and rappels. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 to 4 hours. Dragonfly Canyon requires complete technical gear. The scenery is dramatic. Dragonfly Canyon is rated 3B II using the Canyon Rating System. You will need an Arches Canyoneering Permit to enter Dragonfly Canyon. In normal conditions the route will contain a couple sections of deep wading or swimming. The sections of water are very short and no wet suit is required if the weather is warm or hot. During long dry spells the water can become putrid. The water is contained in several deep potholes. The potholes can be slightly challenging to escape at certain water levels but they can all be defeated with typical pothole escape methods such as a partner assist or pack toss. These potholes should never become a death trap if a little commonsense is used. The route is easy to reverse if upon reaching the potholes you find escaping them beyond your abilities. There are two rappels in the canyon with the highest being a measured 115-feet. Both rappels are from bolted anchors. Two 120-foot ropes are suggested. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, 30-feet of webbing, a couple double length slings, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"The Windows Section\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Dragonfly Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This route has a minor flash flood danger. Trailhead Information: From Arches National Park Visitor Center drive into the park for 5.6 miles to the a small dirt pullout on the east (right) side of the road. This is the Dragonfly Canyon Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify as there is a small '6 mile' mileage marker at the trailhead. If you get to the signed \"Petrified Dunes Viewpoint\" on the east (right) side of the road you have gone too far and need to backtrack 0.2 miles. The small trailhead pullout will accommodates several vehicles. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Please do not park at the Petrified Dunes Viewpoint. Canyoneers parking at the viewpoint are creating social trails leading away from the viewpoint that are causing problems with tourists wandering out into the Petrified Dunes. Now is the time to show the Park Service we can be responsible canyoneers. I would hate to see Arches institute a crappy permit system like the one canyoneers must suffer with in Zion National Park. Route Information: From the Dragonfly Canyon Trailhead (N38° 39' 42\", W109° 35' 18\"), hike northeast for 1/4 mile to the head of Dragonfly Canyon (N38° 39' 51\", W109° 35' 05\"). This 1/4 mile section of hiking is cross-country. Please only walk on slickrock or in wash bottoms to avoid disturbing http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/dragonfly.htm 1/25/2018 Dragonfly - Arches National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 the cryptobiotic crust. This endeavor becomes much easier and more fun if you and your group make a game of not stepping on the cryptobiotic soil. Once you reach the head of Dragonfly Canyon you will be in a wash the remainder of the downstream route. From the head of Dragonfly Canyon just follow the main drainage south. You will soon be presented with a downclimb into a deep water filled pothole. This pothole can be a little tricky to escape at certain water levels. After exiting the pothole continue downstream for 75-yards to a second deep water filled pothole guarding the edge of a 65-foot rappel. The rappel is anchored from two bolts on the west (right) canyon wall. The rappel deposits you on the edge of a pool. From the base of the first rappel continue down canyon and enjoy a short stroll through some wide, but pretty narrows. Just past the wide narrows the canyon will slot up and the bottom will fall out. This is the second and final rappel. The anchors for this 115-foot rappel are two bolts on the east (left) canyon wall. The rappel deposits you at the edge of a pool. The pretty bushes to the side with three leaves are poison ivy. The poison ivy is easy to avoid if you are aware of its existence. The base of the second rappel is a beautiful grotto and is a nice place to enjoy a snack before the refreshing hike out begins. During the hike out you might encounter short sections of quicksand and areas of poison ivy, both of which are easy to avoid. From the grotto continue hiking downstream approximately 3/4 miles to the junction with Courthouse Wash (N38° 38' 58\", W109° 35' 00\"). At the junction turn west (right) and follow Courthouse Wash upstream approximately 1/4 mile to where a small side drainage enters from the north (right) side (N38° 38' 59\", W109° 35' 18\"). This is really the first place that a reasonable escape from Courthouse Wash is possible so it is not extremely difficult to locate. Follow the emerging hiker trail up the small north side drainage to the slickrock above Courthouse Wash. Hike north, staying on slickrock and following a shallow wash, for approximately 1 mile to the Dragonfly Trailhead. Caution: Sections of this route pass near gardens of poison ivy. The poison ivy is easy to avoid if you know what it looks like. Poison ivy has three leaves and is frequently found near water. Poison ivy leaves are green in the summer and red in the fall. Educate yourself before attempting this route. Full Meal Deal: It would be easy to combine Big Horn and Dragonfly Canyon into a day long adventure. If attempting the Full Meal Deal I would suggest starting at the Courthouse Wash Trailhead and doing Big Horn first. This will put all the major hiking in the cool morning and the wet potholes in the warm afternoon. If completing the full meal deal just hike up Courthouse Wash to the Big Horn Trailhead at the end of the day. Courthouse Option: For those who enjoy desert hiking it is easy to combine Dragonfly with Courthouse Wash. Video: Every canyon is better with a video. Cryptobiotic Soil: Follow the route described and you will avoid areas of cryptobiotic crust. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires years of undisturbed growth before it becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/dragonfly.htm 1/25/2018 Dragonfly - Arches National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/dragonfly.htm 1/25/2018 Elephant Butte - Arches National Park - Climbing Page 1 of 4 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Elephant Butte Arches National Park Rock Scramble At 5653' Elephant Butte is the highest point inside Arches National Park. This puts a nice big bulls eye on the summit for those seeking adventure. The route is a phenomenal scramble on a sandstone butte in the middle of a beautifully eroded landscape. The route to the summit requires route selection, rock scrambling and rappelling. General Information: The Elephant Butte route is best described as a scramble that requires two rappels. This route should not be difficult for your average technical canyoneer or rock climber. This route is similar to a canyoneering route with the exception that it runs up-hill. This route is rated 5.4 III using the Yosemite Decimal System or 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. The route will require approximately 4 hours to complete. You will need an Arches Canyoneering Permit to enter Elephant Butte. Elephant Butte requires complete technical gear. The route requires a 120-foot rope. The longest rappel is exactly 60 feet. The rope can also be used to protect a couple of moderately exposed moves and to help novice climbers. Those with sticky shoes will have an advantage on this route. Navigation for this route is moderate. The area can be confusing so paying attention to your map and route description is required. The one bonus is mistakes in navigation are usually not difficult to overcome and correct. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"The Windows Section\" are helpful. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. You will encounter areas of cryptobiotic crust along this route. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A careless hiker can easily destroy decades of growth. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/elephant.htm 1/25/2018 Elephant Butte - Arches National Park - Climbing Page 2 of 4 Trailhead Information: From Arches National Park Visitor Center drive into the park for 8.9 miles to the signed \"Windows\" turn-off. Turn south (right) and follow the Windows Road for 1.2 miles to the signed \"Garden of Eden Viewpoint\". Turn east (left) into the Garden of Eden Viewpoint and find a place to park. The trailhead is identified by a paved parking lot that will accommodate several vehicles. There is no restroom at the trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/elephant.htm 1/25/2018 Elephant Butte - Arches National Park - Climbing Page 3 of 4 Route Information: From the Garden of Eden Trailhead (N38° 41' 53\", W109° 33' 00\"), hike south 50 yards to the base of a spire known as Owl Rock. From the base of Owl Rock you will note a second spire an additional 150 yards south that you must continue hiking towards. Just before you reach the base of the second spire turn east (left) and you will note a major drainage exiting the butte. Follow the drainage into the butte. As you enter the butte the drainage divides with an easy looking canyon to the south (right) and a difficult looking, boulder jumbled canyon on the north (left). You guessed it, the route is up the difficult looking, boulder jumbled canyon. I refer to this as the Entrance Canyon (N38° 41' 48\", W109° 32' 47\"). Climb up, over, and around the sandstone boulders and ledges, gaining elevation into the butte as you follow the major drainage. You will encounter a ledge that is easy to defeat by climbing the ramp on the south (right) side. near the top of the drainage you will enter a large sandy bowl (N38° 41' 51\", W109° 32' 37\"). In the center of the bowl you will note a major slickrock drainage entering from the south (right). You must climb south up this slickrock drainage to a small saddle. About mid-way up the slickrock drainage you will encounter a small theater. The drainage divides in the small theater. The drainage to the east (left) climbs to anther bowl. The correct route is the more obscure drainage to the south (right). This is the crux of the route. The ledge is easiest to climb on the left side and is only about 5.4 but there is some exposure. Most groups have their strongest climber gain the ledge and than belay everyone else over the obstacle. From the top of the theater continue climbing up the slickrock drainage a short distance to a small saddle. Climb through the saddle and descend the crack 20 feet to a large ledge. Downclimbing this crack is not difficult, but you don't want to slip so continue cautiously. The http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/elephant.htm 1/25/2018 Elephant Butte - Arches National Park - Climbing Page 4 of 4 ledge looks scary from above and in pictures but is really a big, wide and relatively flat platform with plenty of room for a large group. When everyone is safely on the large platform you will find bolted rappel anchors (N38° 41' 48\", W109° 32' 33\") on the east (left) side of the platform. The bolts are difficult to see until you look over the edge. The 60-foot rappel deposits you on the canyon floor. Once you reach the canyon floor pull your ropes and downclimb the small slot canyon for 30 feet to a large sandy bowl. From the floor of the large sandy bowl hike east. You will immediately pass through a mass of large boulders before reaching the barren sandstone slope of the upper butte. Scramble up the sandstone butte staying more to the south (right) than the north (left). Watch for a crack (N38° 41' 44\", W109° 32' 26\") in the upper ten foot cliff band. This crack is the final key to gaining the summit. Squeeze up through the crack and hike 100-yards to the summit of Elephant Butte (N38° 41' 44\", W109° 32' 24\"). The summit contains a register set in sandstone rocks. The register is filled with several interesting names. To descend, retrace your route back down through the crack. At the base of the crack you want to chose the correct exit drainage. The exit drainage is easy to identify if you remember it's the one with the giant spire (N38° 41' 45\", W109° 32' 31\") in its center. Hike down past the spire and continue hiking down the drainage as it narrows. The drainage contains several small pothole, that could contain water, but it's easy to keep your feet dry if you use a little ingenuity. The exit drainage ends at an overhanging rappel. The rappel is 50 feet and is anchor by three ancient pitons. From the bottom of the rappel you must scramble down one more ledge and hike north along the face of the butte back to the Garden of Eden Trailhead. Please do your best to avoid the cryptobiotic crust on the hike back. Video: Enjoy a short video from Elephant Butte.

The upper canyon section is Entrada sandstone and the lower canyon section is Navajo sandstone. You pass through a very distinct boundary between these two layers while traveling down the canyon. This short but fun slot canyon packs a big punch into a small package. General Information: Entrajo Canyon is a technical canyoneering route that requires complete technical gear. The route will require approximately 3 hours to complete. The route should be assessable year round, but winter would be very cold. Entrajo is rated 3B II with the Canyon Rating System. This route is beginner friendly with competent leadership. Navigation for this route is moderate. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Kane Springs\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. In normal conditions this route will have at least one swim and some wading. This canyon has the ability to hold a lot of water during wet weather. Wetsuits are advised for all but the warmest conditions. The longest rappel in the canyon is 90-feet and a 60 meter rope is required. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Trailhead Information: From the center of Moab head south out of town on U.S. Highway 191 for approximately 7 1/2 miles to mile marker 117.9 (N38° 29' 13\", W109° 27' 46\"). Turn east (left) on the signed Kens Lake Road. Follow the road east for 0.5 miles to a tee. Turn south (right) on the LaSal Mountain Loop Road. Follow the road south for 0.6 miles to a fork (N38° 28' 45\", W109° 26' 54\"), take the east (left) fork. Follow the road east for 0.8 miles to the signed Kens Lake Road (N38° 28' 17\", W109° 26' 12\") on the east (left) side of the highway. Turn east on the Kens Lake Road and follow it for 0.5 miles to a junction (N38° 28' 36\", W109° 25' 20\"), The paved Kens Lake Road turns north (left), the Flat Pass Road turns to dirt and veers east (right). Follow the Flat Pass Road to the east. Follow the dirt road for 1.7 miles as the road climbs through a small pass and than descends steeply into Mill Creek Canyon to a tee (N38° 28' 59\", W109° 24' 28\"). Passenger vehicles should probably park at the top of the pass and not descend down to the tee. This will add less than 1/2 mile of hiking to your route. At the tee turn east (right) on the signed \"Steel Bender\" 4x4 trail. follow the Steel Bender Trail for 0.3 miles to a small parking area and a BLM fence guarding several petroglyphs on the cliff. This is the Entrajo Trailhead. Four Wheel Drive vehicles will have no trouble reaching this trailhead. All other vehicle might want to stop at the top of the pass 1/2 mile before the actual trailhead. All vehicles should be able to access the road to the top of the pass in good weather conditions. Route Information: Before you begin hiking you will probably want to look at the highly vandalized http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/entrajo.htm 1/25/2018 Entrajo Canyon - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 petroglyphs on the canyon wall. There are a few good panels still remaining but most of the wall is covered in gringo-glyphs. From the Entrajo Trailhead (N38° 28' 51\", W109° 24' 11\"), hike southeast along the road on the south side of the river for 250 yards to an obvious and inviting looking slot canyon on the south (right) side of the road (N38° 28' 48\", W109° 24' 03\"). This is the end of Entrajo Canyon. You can walk up the slot canyon 30-yards and see the bottom stage of the dryfall that creates the final rappel. From the mouth of Entrajo Canyon you must retrace your steps, back down the road for 25- yards to a side drainage and an emerging hiker trail that will let you climb around and get above the dryfall that blocks the bottom of Entrajo Canyon. Once above the dryfall hike up the bottom of the drainage for approximately 1/4 mile to where the canyon begins to narrow up. Watch the west (right) wall for the last possible escape from the canyon bottom (N38° 28' 35\", W109° 23' 49\") before the route narrows and deepens. This is actually easier than it sounds because you will soon be blocked by a small dryfall if you continue up the slot to far and it's easy to backtrack. The escape from the canyon bottom is a scramble straight up the escape drainage. You will gain approximately 200 feet in altitude. The escape drainage has some minor scrambling but nothing difficult. Once above the escape drainage you will find a hiker trail leading south, follow it for approximately 200-yards to where it turns to slickrock. At this point you should have a clear view of the canyon below. Traverse the slickrock in a southerly direction, employing some easy route finding, to where you can walk into the canyon bottom (N38° 28' 26\", W109° 23' 50\"). Explore up canyon as far as you like. The up canyon exploration is a fun challenge that visits a nice section of slot canyon. After exploring up canyon return and start downstream. Let the technical section begin. The first big pothole might be the most difficult challenge in the canyon. You can defeat it by climbing round to the west (left) side and partner assisting down. Several potholes and downclimbs will deposit you at the first rappel, which is 20-feet and anchored from a large rock. This is followed by several more downclimbs and the end of the short but amusing slot. Hike downstream to the dryfall you hiked around at the beginning of the route. This rappel is a two-stage deal that is 90-feet total in length. The anchor is from a large cedar tree high on the east (right) side of the canyon. From the bottom of the rappel hike back to the trailhead. Video: Enjoy a short video of Entrajo Canyon. Guide Service: Desert Highlights provides a very reasonably priced, professional guide service for Entrajo Canyon. No previous climbing or rappelling experience is required to go on a trip when accompanied by one of their experienced guides.

While located in a naturally occurring cave, the name False Kiva arises from the uncertainty around the circle of stones' origins and purpose, not whether it is really an authentic kiva. It has become a popular spot for photographers capturing the Southwest, offering a unique frame for the dramatic thunderstorms or clear skies beyond. General Information: False Kiva is a well preserved native American ruin located inside the Island in the Sky District of Canyonlands National Park. The trail to False Kiva has some exposure and those who have trouble with heights, or children, might want to look for anther adventure. A round trip to False Kiva requires approximately 2 or 3 hours, depending on how much time you spend at the actual kiva. The route is approximately 2 miles each way and does contain some elevation gain on the hike out. The ruin is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground, at which time this would not be a wise adventure. False Kiva is rated 1A II using the Canyon Rating System. \"Upheaval Dome\" is the USGS 7.5 minute topographical map that shows False Kiva. Navigation for this adventure is moderate. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: This hike is located near Moab inside the Island in the Sky District of Canyonlands National Park. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles, year round, via a paved highway. From Moab head north out of town on U.S. Highway 191. Cross the bridge over the Colorado River. After crossing the bridge continue north for 8.3 miles to the junction with State Road 313, signed Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands. Turn west (left) onto State Road 313 and drive 14.6 miles to a junction signed Dead Horse Point/Canyonlands. Continue straight ahead towards Canyonlands on Island in the Sky Road and drive an additional 13.2 miles to a junction. Turn west (right) onto the signed Upheaval Dome Road and follow it for 3.6 miles to the signed Alcove Spring Trailhead located on the east (right) side of the road. The trailhead has parking for half-a-dozen vehicles. Route Information: From the Alcove Spring Trailhead (N38° 25' 22\", W109° 54' 32\") hike south on the paved road for 200-yards to a well-defined trail heading west. This is the trail to False Kiva (N38° 25' 16\", W109° 54' 31\"). The trail is not signed. If you find yourself following a well established social trail down a wash you are on the wrong trail. The correct trail is 20-yards further south. Follow the trail west for 3/4 miles to a dryfall (N38° 25' 07\", W109° 54' 45\"). You can bypass the dryfall on the south (left) side. Once at the base of the dryfall follow the well cairned trail downstream, as it begins to swing north and descend a rocky ledge system. As you descend the ledge system you will see a smaller alcove high and to your east (right), that contains False http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/falsekiva.htm 1/25/2018 False Kiva Ruins - Canyonlands Page 2 of 2 Kiva. The trail descends below and past False Kiva utilizing various ledge systems, and than climbs back up to False Kiva (N38° 25' 08\", W109° 55' 08\") using more ledges. The ledge system is always at least three feet wide, but does contain some exposure. Those who have trouble with heights might want to look for anther adventure.

The petroglyphs are easy to visit and fun for the entire family. The petroglyphs have a mixture of human, animal, anthromorphs, patterns and abstract forms. This is an exceptional collection of rock art. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Fighting Men Petroglyphs contains of an amazing medley of easy to access rock art. The petroglyphs are located along the relatively well-traveled access road into the Needles district of Canyonlands National Park. A round trip to Fighting Men Petroglyphs requires approximately one hour. The actual hike is only a couple minutes each way, but you will want to spend more time scrambling along the base of the cliff searching out the numerous panels of rock art. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. A GPS is useful in locating the petroglyphs. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \" Harts Point South\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Fighting Men Petroglyphs is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: This short hike is located just outside of Canyonlands Needles District. The route is accessible to all vehicles, year round, via a paved highway.

From Monticello, Utah: Travel north on Highway 191 for 15 miles to the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211. The junction is signed Canyonlands. From The Junction: At the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211 (N38° 04' 27\", W109° 21' 00\"), follow Highway 211 west for 15.5 miles to mile marker 3.3 and a small parking area on the east (right) side of the road. This is the Fighting Men Petroglyph Trailhead. The small dirt parking area has room for three or four vehicles. For those familiar with the area all you really need to know is the trailhead is 3.4 miles west of Newspaper Rock on Highway 211. Route Information: From the Fighting Men Petroglyph Trailhead (N38° 01' 49\", W109° 32' 27\") walk north on the highway for 75-yards, at which point you should be directly below the Fighting Men Petroglyph (N38° 01' 54\", W109° 32' 26\"). Climb up the hill to the base of the cliff to locate a large number of petroglyph panels scattered along the base of the cliff. The more you explore the more rock art you will uncover.

The route lacks the signature feature associated with most canyoneering routes, but that is made up for on the exit hike which visits three excellent panels of rock art and two outstanding swimming holes. General Information: Fins & Things is a technical canyoneering route that is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. Fins & Things is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This route is about as easy and simple as technical canyoneering routes comes. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 hours. Fins & Things requires complete technical gear. This canyon is accessible year round. Fins & Things is one of the few canyons in the area that make both a good winter and summer route as it contains two excellent, but easily avoidable swimming holes. If doing this route in summer get an early start and bring plenty of water as it takes a couple of hours before you will reach the first swimming hole. Navigation for this route is moderate. The route does traverse through some areas of cryptobiotic soil but they are easy to avoid with a little care. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Moab\" and \"Rill Creek\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a minor flash flood danger. In normal conditions this route might require some very minor knee to possibly waist deep wading, everyone will have to do some ankle deep wading at some point along the way. The route contains two rappels, both being 12-feet in length. One 30-foot rope is required for this route. Additional gear should consist of a couple shoulder length slings and 20-feet of webbing. The anchors in this canyon are all natural and easy to locate. Fee Information: A Sand Flats Permit is required to enter the Sand Flats Recreational Area (SFRA), which includes the Fins and Things canyoneering route. Fins & Things Trailhead: The Fins & Things Trailhead is where you begin. From 300 South and Main Street in Moab. Turn east on 300 South and follow it 4 blocks to where it tee's into 400 East. Turn south (right) and follow 400 East for 100 yards to Mill Creek Drive. Turn east (left) on Mill Creek Drive and follow it 0.5 miles to a 3-way stop. At the 3-way stop you must continue straight ahead on Sand Flats Road. From the 3-way stop follow Sand Flats Road 1.7 miles to the BLM toll booth. From the BLM toll booth drive an additional 1.8 miles to Campsite \"E\" located on the south (right) side of the road. This is the trailhead for both the Fins & Things 4x4 route and canyoneering route. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/finsandthings.htm 1/25/2018 Fins & Things - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Mill Creek Trailhead: The Mill Creek Trailhead is where you leave your shuttle vehicle. From 300 South and Main Street in Moab. Turn east on 300 South and follow it 4 blocks to where it tee's into 400 East. Turn south (right) and follow 400 East for 100 yards to Mill Creek Drive. Turn east (left) on Mill Creek Drive and follow it 0.5 miles to a 3-way stop. At the 3-way stop you must turn south (right) to continue following Mill Creek Road. From the 3-way stop follow Mill Creek Road an additional 0.5 miles to Power House Road. Turn east (left) on Power House Road and follow it 0.7 miles to the Mill Creek Trailhead. The trailhead is identified by a large dirt parking area with an information kiosk on the east side. There are no restrooms at the Mill Creek Trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: From the Fins & Things Trailhead (N38° 34' 52\", W109° 30' 01\") walk south through Campsite \"E\" and follow the Fins & Thing 4x4 route. Follow the 4x4 route across the sand and slickrock for 1/2 mile until you reach a large dead tree (N38° 34' 36\", W109° 29' 36\") next to the 4x4 road. From the large dead tree hike 100-yards south and you will encounter the head of Fins & Things Canyon (N38° 34' 33\", W109° 29' 34\"). Begin hiking down canyon and let the fun begin. The first obstacle you will encounter is a giant chokestone blocking the route. You can squeeze through the opening under the chokestone or climb over the top, pick your poison. After the chokestone is a short slot section followed by a small downclimb. Next up is a minor pothole that normally contains ankle to knee deep water, this is usually the only place that regularly has unavoidable water, if you make it through this section with dry pants you should be able to keep them dry the rest of the way. We usually carry kids, wives and girlfriends over this section of water, just don't let your wife see you carrying your girlfriend. The pothole is followed by the first rappel, which is 12-feet and anchored from a deadman. This rappel can be downclimbed by the highly skilled or with a partner assist from below. A short downclimb and jump looks very inviting but please avoid that as jumping is the leading cause of canyoneering injuries. The second rappel follows immediately after the first. The second rappel is 12-feet and anchored from a tree. The second rappel is a very awkward rappel and it's good to have a more experienced canyoneer go first if possible to help beginners from below. After the second rappel the canyon opens up and joins the North Fork of Mill Creek (N38° 34' 13\", W109° 29' 18\"). Unlike most canyoneering routes the hike out is actually one of the highlights of this route. Hike downstream for 1/4 mile following the social trails along the north wall and you will encounter a large alcove. Inside the large alcove is the Many Hands Pictograph Panel (N38° 34' 17\", W109° 29' 30\"). The pictograph panel consists of many hands and several other figures. Please do not touch the rock art. After visiting the pictograph panel continue downstream for 1/3 mile and you will find a petroglyph consisting of three large bighorn sheep (N38° 34' 09\", W109° 29' 49\"). The petroglyph is located on the north canyon wall at the base of the cliff. From the petroglyph it is just a 200-yard hike downstream to the upper swimming hole (N38° 34' 04\", W109° 29' 44\"). From the upper swimming hole just keep hiking downstream for 1/2 mile and you will reach the main or most popular swimming hole in Mill Creek Canyon (N38° 33' 51\", W109° 30' 13\"). From the main swimming hole hike downstream 250-yards and you will see several large boulders on a ledge above the stream on the south side. These large boulders (N38° 33' 49\", W109° 30' 22\") are covered with interesting petroglyphs. Continue hiking downstream and in 100-yards the South Fork of Mill Creek joins from the south (left) side. Just keep hiking downstream following the well defined trail and in 3/4 miles you will reach the Mill Creek Trailhead (N38° 33' 43\", W109° 31' 02\"). Optional Route: For those without a car shuttle it's possible to loop back up to the Fins & Things Trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/finsandthings.htm 1/25/2018 Fins & Things - Moab - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 This optional route requires scrambling and competent route finding skills. This is not a good choice of options during hot weather. When Fins & Things Canyon reaches the North Fork of Mill Creek turn east (left), instead of west, and follow Mill Creek upstream for 3/4 miles, at which point you will want to leave the trail and climb through a weakness (N38° 33' 59\", W109° 28' 41\") to the top of the north side bench. Once above the small cliff band and on top of the bench hike northeast for 200-yards to the base of a slickrock ramp. The route is not exactly obvious at first but you scramble up the slickrock ramp to a gulley. Scramble up the gulley as it narrows until you reach the top of the mesa. Once on top of the mesa you must navigate and route find you way through a maze of sandstone domes back to the Fins & Things 4x4 route you hiked earlier in the day. So long as you are hiking northwest you will eventually intersect the 4x4 route or Sand Flats Road.

A stock Jeep or 4x4 truck should be able to reach this trailhead with little problem in dry conditions. This road is impassable in wet weather. The first mile of the road is the most difficult, after that you will be driving up the bottom of a dry wash. From Moab, Utah: Travel south on Highway 191 for 40 miles to the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211. The junction is signed Canyonlands. From Monticello, Utah: Travel north on Highway 191 for 15 miles to the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211. The junction is signed Canyonlands. From The Junction: At the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211 (N38° 04' 27\", W109° 21' 00\"), follow Highway 211 west for 26.0 miles to a bridge where Highway 211 crosses Indian Creek. The signed Davis Canyon Road (N38° 09' 09\", W109° 37' 38\") is on the west end of the bridge. Turn south on the Davis Canyon Road and follow it for 3.1 miles to a junction (N38° 06' 48\", W109° 38' 16\"). The road to the east (left) leads to Lavender Canyon, continue south (straight ahead) and drive an additional 4.6 miles to where a fence blocks the road and dry wash. This is the Canyonlands National Park boundary and the Davis Canyon Trailhead. You will find a small kiosk and backcountry register at the trailhead. Route Information: From the Davis Canyon Trailhead (N38° 04' 00\", W109° 40' 55\") follow the wash southwest for 300-yards and you will locate a large alcove high on the canyon wall with a granary inside and rock art (N38° 04' 01\", W109° 41' 06\") on the north side. The granary and rock art are easy to see from the base of the cliff. A pair of binoculars to view from below might prove beneficial. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/fivefaces.htm 1/25/2018 Five Faces Pictograph - Canyonlands National Park Page 2 of 2 From the granary alcove follow one of several hiker trails that leads south, around the large rock outcropping and back north into a small box canyon to the Five Faces Pictograph (N38° 03' 57\", W109° 41' 13\"). It is about 1/4 mile from the granary alcove to Five Faces Pictograph. The pictographs are located on a ledge about 50-feet above the canyon floor. To reach the actual rock art you will need to use a ledge system on the west side of the small box canyon. Log Cabin Ruin: For those that want a longer hike you can follow Davis Canyon south for 2 miles to Log Cabin Ruin (N38° 03' 14\", W109° 42' 11\"). You can't actually reach the ruin as it is located on a ledge about 50-feet up on the north wall of the canyon. The ruin is best view with a pair of binoculars from below.

If you want a nice arch all to yourself only a short distance from Moab this is the one for you. And to add a little spice to the adventure the route passes next to several petroglyph panels. General Information: Funnel Arch is not difficult and can be completed by any healthy adult or child. The route involves easy scrambling, with minimal exposure, to a beautiful arch. The arch is located approximately 1/4 mile from the trailhead and will require one or two hours round trip from the trailhead. I suggest everyone carry a 60-rope to use as a handline and to raise and lower packs if required. Experienced hikers, beginning canyoneers and beginning rock climbers will have no problems with this route. Others might require a little help a little help from a handline in one short section. Every member of your hiking party should carry at least one liter of water. This hike should be easily accessible year round. Navigation for this hike is moderate. There is no marked trail but the hike is short and errors in navigation are easy to correct. GPS waypoints are provided for convenience. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" shows the area. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. This route is rated 3 I using the Yosemite Decimal System or 2A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the corner of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 4.7 miles to where the pavement ends at a cattle guard (N38° 32' 03\", W109° 36' 00\"). From the cattle guard follow the well maintained gravel road south for 1.4 miles to a pull-out on the west (right) side of the road. Approximately 75-feet west and down slope from the pull-out is a large boulder with rock art on all four sides commonly known as the Birthing Scene (N38° 31' 19\", W109° 36' 10\"). The large boulder should be easy to see from the road. Walk down and take a look, but remember not to touch. From the Birthing Scene pull-out continue following the well maintained gravel road south for an additional 0.3 miles to a small pull-out on the north (left) side of the road. This is the Funnel Arch Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify as it is located just past the point where the road begins to descend to Kane Creek. You will also notice the trailhead is located at the base of the only weakness in the massive cliff. This trailhead is accessible to all vehicles. Route Information: From the Funnel Arch Trailhead (N38° 31' 12\", W109° 36' 02\"), hike north and head for the obvious weakness in the cliff band. The most difficult part of this hike is scrambling up through the dryfall that forms the weakness. If you search east (right) along the cliff band at the same level as the base of the dryfall you will will find several petroglyphs. Most are of poor quality but we did find a few good ones. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/funnel.htm 1/25/2018 Funnel Arch - Moab Page 2 of 2 Scrambling up over the dryfall is easy for experienced hikers or beginning rock climbers. Others might require a little help. There used to be a cable hanging down the dryfall that was used as a handline, but the cable has been removed. I suggest you bring a 60-foot rope to use as a handline for those who might require a little extra assistance. The rope is easily anchored to a large tree at the top of the dryfall. Once over the dryfall, turn east (right) and pass between two large sandstone fins and then hike up the bottom of the wash. After approximately 40-yards, climb out of the wash to the north (left) and you should see Funnel Arch (N38° 31' 20\", W109° 35' 55\"). Funnel Arch Statistics: Greater Arch Dimension (GAD): 45.0 feet. For this arch, the GAD is its span. Lesser Arch Dimension (LAD): 34.0 feet. For this arch, the LAD is its height. Arch Type: Fin Rock formation and/or type: Navajo Sandstone Video: Enjoy a short video of Funnel Arch.

The route traverses some of the most beautiful red rock country in southern Utah. The route is beginner friendly with competent leadership. General Information: Granary Canyon is suitable for intermediate canyoneers with basic natural anchor building skills and beginners with skilled leadership. This canyon requires complete technical gear. Granary Canyon is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 6 to 7 hours. This canyon is accessible year round, but the route is miserable during the hot summer month's. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. Navigation for this route is moderate. To avoid wandering and trampling the cryptobiotic soil a GPS is mandatory if you have not completed this route before. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Gold Bar Canyon\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a minor flash flood danger. In normal conditions the route will contain a couple small water filled potholes that can usually be avoided with a little effort and teamwork. There are five rappels in the canyon with the highest being 195-feet. Two 60-meter ropes are required for this route, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. The anchors in this canyon are all easy to locate, but a couple of them require a substantial amount of webbing to create easy rope pulls and to avoid rope burns in the sandstone. Please do your part, use a little extra webbing and do not scare the sandstone. Trailhead Information: The standard Granary Canyon route requires a shuttle vehicle. It begins at the Granary Canyon Trailhead and ends at the Jug Handle Trailhead. An optional route which begins and ends at the Granary Canyon Trailhead and eliminates the vehicle shuttle is also presented. Both the Jug Handle Trailhead and the Granary Canyon Trailhead can be accessed with a passenger vehicle. A much shorter shuttle can be arranged if you are using a 4x4 as your shuttle vehicle. This guide will detail both options and you can pick your poison. Jug Handle Trailhead: From Moab head north out of town on U.S. Highway 191. Cross the bridge over the Colorado River. After crossing the bridge continue north for 1.3 miles to the signed \"Potash\" road, which is State Road 279. Turn west (left) and follow State Road 279 for 13.8 miles to Mile Marker 1.8 and the Long Canyon Road. The Long Canyon Road is dirt and located on the west (right) side of the highway. Turn onto the Long Canyon Road, cross the railroad tracks and find a safe place to park. This is the Jug Handle Trailhead and it is where you need to leave a shuttle vehicle. Granary Canyon Trailhead: 4x4 Option: This option is available to all real 4x4 vehicles and most high clearance vehicles (standard pick-up trucks) in normal conditions. From the Jug Handle Trailhead follow the dirt road 4.8 up Long Canyon to a small gravel pit on the east (right) side of the road. This is http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/granary.htm 1/25/2018 Granary Canyon - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 the Granary Canyon Trailhead. Drive time between the two trailheads using the Long Canyon Road is approximately 30 minutes. Passenger Vehicle Option: From the Jug handle Trailhead drive back on the Potash Road to highway 191. Turn north (left) on highway 191 and follow it for 7.0 miles to the junction with State Road 313, signed Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands. Turn west (left) on State Road 313 and follow it for 14.3 miles to a junction signed Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands. Take the south (left) road, signed Dead Horse Point, and follow the road for an additional 1.6 miles to mile marker 6.4 where the Long Canyon dirt road departs to the east (left). This dirt road is not signed but is very heavily traveled and in very good condition to the trailhead. Stay on the main dirt road, do not turn-off on any of the spur roads. Follow the Long Canyon road east for 2.6 miles to a small gravel pit on the east (left) side of the road. This is the Granary Canyon Trailhead. Drive time between the two trailheads using the paved highway is approximately 60 minutes. Route Information: From the Granary Canyon Trailhead (N38° 32' 23\", W109° 42' 54\"), hike northeast following an old 4x4 track for a little over 3/4 mile. Its better to hike to far along this 4x4 track then not far enough. After 3/4 miles of hiking along the old 4x4 track turn east (N38° 32' 50\", W109° 42' 26\"), and begin hiking cross-country. With a little effort you can avoid most of the cryptobiotic soil in the area. Stay on existing trails, illegal ATV tracks, walk in wash bottoms and on slickrock. As you begin hiking south the trick is to keep Long Canyon to your south (right) and the unnamed drainage to your north (left). Soon you will be hiking on the ridge between the two, which is mostly slickrock. The ridge narrows up to almost a scramble at one point (N38° 32' 58\", W109° 41' 53\"), offering dramatic views into Long Canyon and the north side drainage. We located numerous arches and bridges along the Long Canyon ridge. Soon the ridge you are hiking on widens out and the drainage to your left turns north. Keep hiking along the ridge keeping Long Canyon to your immediate south (right). Shortly the ridge will begin to narrow up again and a second drainage will appear on your north (left) side. Again this will narrow up to a point where you are required to complete some minor scrambling (N38° 33' 01\", W109° 41' 23\"). After the minor scramble the ridge will widen out for a second time. After the ridge widens out for the second time you can walk down into the drainage on your north (left) side. Follow the largest wash and it should deposit you near the top of the first rappel (N38° 33' 12\", W109° 40' 55\"). The first rappel is 75-feet and is anchored by a large tree, it usually does not have webbing on it as it is frequently removed by a local guide service. This first rappel can also be easily downclimbed by using a crack just to the south (right) of the rappel anchor. The downclimbable crack is visible from the top of the first rappel. The first three rappels are rapid-fire, just pull your rope down and drag it to the next anchor, no need to coil or bag. The second rappel, known locally as \"The Snail\", is 65 feet and is anchored from a tree located behind a pothole. This rappel is easy to rig but can require approximately 50-feet of webbing if the anchor needs to be extended or replaced. The third rappel, known as \"The Onion\" is 40-feet and is anchored by two bolts on the north (left) side of the canyon. After The Onion it's a short romp down canyon to a nifty natural bridge recognized as the \"Tea Garden\". The fourth rappel is immediately after the natural bridge. If you use the natural bridge as an anchor please use webbing and do not pull ropes directly over the sandstone forming the bridge. Using the natural bridge as an anchor requires a lot of webbing. There are many other easy and less obnoxious natural anchors nearby, please consider using them. Continue downstream and enjoy the obstacles. You will encounter a few more fun items that are easy to defeat before the canyon deposits you out into a wide sandy wash (N38° 33' 09\", W109° 40' 01\"). This is the exit for those without a shuttle vehicle. Everyone else needs to just keep hiking downstream and follow the sandy wash. Eventually the wash will end at an impressive 500-foot dryfall (N38° 33' 07\", W109° 39' 40\"). Admire the view, and then begin http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/granary.htm 1/25/2018 Granary Canyon - Moab - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 hiking east, following the rim of Long Canyon. You will hike until you can hike no further. You should end up standing on the edge of a cliff looking down at the Colorado River. The turn-off to Long Canyon should be visible to your south (right) and Jug Handle Arch should be visible to your north (left). At this point turn around and the large tree 50-feet behind you is your rappel anchor (N38° 32' 54\", W109° 38' 57\"). The fifth rappel is 195-feet, if your ropes are short you will be in trouble. You will also want to make certain that your rappel anchor extends over the edge of the cliff or you will not be able to pull your ropes. There is a small ledge just below the edge of the cliff to stand on so getting on rappel is not too difficult with the webbing extended over the edge. At the base of the final rappel if you look south (right) about 50-feet you will find the small granary for which the canyon is named. From the granary scramble down through the talus to the Jug Handle Trailhead (N38° 32' 48\", W109° 38' 54\"). Optional Return: The Optional Return is for those without a shuttle vehicle. When the Standard Route deposits you out into a wide sandy wash you must escape the wash and hike north-northwest for just over 1/2 mile until you intersect a 4x4 route (N38° 33' 39\", W109° 40' 19\"). The cross- country navigation and route finding is moderate for experienced canyoneers and hikers. The 4x4 route can be difficult to locate in some sections but once you find it navigation becomes easy. Once on the 4x4 route follow it west for 2 1/2 miles to a junction (N38° 33' 01\", W109° 42' 24\"). The 4x4 route leading south (left) is the same road you hiked in on at the beginning of the day. Follow the road for 3/4 miles back to the Granary Canyon Trailhead. Cryptobiotic Soil: This route crosses area covered with cryptobiotic soil. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires years of undisturbed growth before it becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth.

This is a splendid hike that can be organized into several different configurations to meet your desires. General Information: This outstanding hike can be configured several different ways. The route described here will be a traverse from the Hidden Valley Trailhead to the Moab Rim Trailhead. This route can be completed in either direction or as an out and back from either trailhead. If you have a shuttle vehicle the traverse would be the preferred option. If you want to visit the rock art and do not have a shuttle using the Hidden Valley Trailhead would be the easiest route. Mountain bikes and 4x4's will want to use the Moab Rim Trailhead and hike from roads end. It will require a short day to visit the rock art and ruin, no matter which route you use. Completing the Hidden Valley to Moab Rim Traverse requires approximately 5 to 6 hours, which includes time to enjoy and explore. The route requires some steep hiking but no major obstacles. This route is a great winter and cold weather route, but would be brutally hot during the summer months. The complete traverse from trailhead to trailhead is 8 miles long. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least two liters of water. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The Hidden Valley to Moab Rim Traverse is rated 1A III using the Canyon Rating System. 4x4 and Mountain Bikes: The Moab Rim Road is open to 4x4's and mountain bikes. This road is serious, hardcore, four wheeling requiring modified vehicles. Don't even consider attempting this route in a stock vehicle. The route is popular with mountain bikes. Moab Rim Trailhead: This trailhead is accessible year round to all vehicles. Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the comer of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 2.6 miles to the Moab Rim Trailhead on the south (left) side of the road. The trailhead is easily identified by a kiosk and restroom. Hidden Valley Trailhead: This trailhead is accessible year round to all vehicles. Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the comer of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Main Street south for 3.2 miles to Angel Rock Road located on the west (right) side of the highway, there is a small sign pointing the way to Hidden Valley. Turn west on Angel Rock Road and follow it 0.3 miles to a tee with Rim Rock Lane. Turn north (right) on Rim Rock Lane and follow it for 0.6 miles to the signed Hidden Valley http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/hidden.htm 1/25/2018 Hidden Valley to Moab Rim Traverse - Moab Page 2 of 2 Trailhead. The trailhead is easily identified by a information kiosk. This is all the trailhead for the Pipe Dream mountain bike route. Route Information: From the Hidden Valley Trailhead (N38° 31' 54\", W109° 31' 02\"), follow the trail signed Hidden Valley that begins next to the information kiosk. The trail is easy to follow and well maintained, as it climbs steeply. After 1/2 mile of vertical hiking you will reach the entrance to the hanging valley (N38° 31' 52\", W109° 31' 21\"), known as Hidden Valley. At this point the trail levels dramatically and the hike becomes an easy stroll. From the entrance to Hidden Valley hike northwest for 1 1/2 miles following the well used trail. At the head of Hidden Valley you will encounter a rock formation (N38° 32' 31\", W109° 32' 37\"), and the main trail descends the north side of the pass. On the south side of the rock formation you will find a smaller use trail that climbs towards the cliffs to the east. Follow the smaller use trail for 300-yards to the base of the cliffs and the beginning of some outstanding rock art (N38° 32' 33\", W109° 32' 46\"). Follow the base of the cliff for 400-yards enjoying numerous panels of rock art along the entire route. It's obvious that native Americans have used the Hidden Valley route for thousands of years. From the end of the rock art (N38° 32' 34\", W109° 32' 56\") you will see a large cliff, 400- yards to the northwest, that protrudes into the valley. The Anasazi Ruin known as \"Watch Tower\" is located on top of the very end of the protrusion (N38° 32' 38\", W109° 33' 07\"). To reach the Watch Tower you must scramble up the nose of the protrusion. Near the top your path will be blocked by a small cliff of capstone. Search around to the north side of the protrusion and you will find a 10-foot tall crack that can be climbed to reach the top of the protrusion. At first the crack will look intimidating, but its easy to climb if you walk into the crack as far as possible. There you will find plenty of features that allow you to climb straight up about as easy as climbing a ladder. The fall potential is almost nil as you are tucked tightly into the crack. From the Watch Tower you have a choice. You can return the way you came. You can try and find the dinosaur tracks (N38° 32' 31\", W109° 33' 14\") or you can hike northeast for 300- yards to the end of the Moab Rim 4x4 Road (N38° 32' 38\", W109° 33' 21\"). If you attempt to locate the dinosaur tracks it helps to know they are in the bottom of the wash, of poor quality, and difficult to locate unless you know what to look for. After some searching we located about six tracks, 5\" in size, in two distinct trackways. Both trackways were from a three-toed dinosaur, perhaps the same dinosaur as the tracks were all approximately the same size. If you are completing the traverse of the Moab Rim you need to hike over to the Moab Rim Road and follow it north. The junctions are all signed and you want to follow the arrows that say \"Moab Rim\". From where the Hidden Valley Trail meets the Moab Rim Road it is 3 1/2 mile of easy hiking to the Moab Rim Trailhead (N38° 33' 31\", W109° 34' 59\"). The Moab Rim Road offers spectacular views of Spanish Valley, Behind the Rocks and the Colorado River. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

The petroglyphs are easy to visit and fun for the entire family. The petroglyphs have a mixture of human, animal, anthromorphs, patterns and abstract forms. This is an exceptional collection of rock art. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Hog Canyon Petroglyphs consists of an amazing selection of easy to access rock art. The petroglyphs are located along the relatively well-traveled access road into the Needles district of Canyonlands National Park. A round trip to Hog Canyon Petroglyphs requires approximately one hour. The actual hike is only a couple minutes each way, but you will want to spend more time scrambling along the base of the cliff searching out the numerous panels of rock art. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. A GPS is useful in locating the petroglyphs. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \" Harts Point South\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Hog Canyon Petroglyphs is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: This short hike is located just outside of Canyonlands Needles District. The route is accessible to all vehicles, year round, via a paved highway. From Moab, Utah: Travel south on Highway 191 for 40 miles to the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211. The junction is signed Canyonlands. From Monticello, Utah: Travel north on Highway 191 for 15 miles to the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211. The junction is signed Canyonlands. From The Junction: At the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211 (N38° 04' 27\", W109° 21' 00\"), follow Highway 211 west for 15.2 miles to mile marker 3.6 and a small parking area on the east (right) side of the road. This is the Hog Canyon Petroglyph Trailhead. The small dirt parking area has room for three or four vehicles. For those familiar with the area all you really need to know is the trailhead is 3.1 miles west of Newspaper Rock on Highway 211. Route Information: From the Hog Canyon Petroglyph Trailhead (N38° 01' 32\", W109° 32' 22\") follow the well constructed trail northeast as it climbs to the base of the cliff's. This trail was constructed by rock climbers to allow easy access to the numerous climbing routes located along the cliff. Rock climbing on routes located above or directly next to native American rock art is prohibited. Once the trail reaches the base of the cliff you will find several nice panels of petroglyphs (N38° 01' 34\", W109° 32' 19\") to the east (right) as you hike along the base of the cliff. After you have finish hike west (left) along the base of the cliff and you will soon reach several panels http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/hogcanyon.htm 1/25/2018 Hog Canyon Petroglyphs - Canyonlands National Park Page 2 of 2 of even better petroglyphs (N38° 01' 38\", W109° 32' 22\"). The more you explore the more rock art you will uncover as there are petroglyph panels scattered along the entire base of the cliff. Additional Rock Art: Newspaper Rock, Shay Canyon Petroglyphs, Hog Canyon Petroglyphs and Fighting Men Petroglyphs are normally combined to create a delightful half-day adventure visiting native American rock art.

These two stimulating panels of rock art are located next to the highway and require no hiking. General Information: The Intestine Man Pictograph Panel and TV Sheep Petroglyph Panel are located next to the highway and can easily be visited by all family members. A round trip to visit both panels requires about 15 minutes. Binoculars are extremely useful for viewing the intricate detail of Intestine Man from ground level. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. A GPS is useful in verifying you are at the correct location. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Merrimac Butte\" shows the area described. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. A tour involving Intestine Man, Snake in Mouth and the rock art panels in Sevenmile Canyon are usually combined into an impressive adventure requiring about half-a-day. Trailhead Information: This roadside attraction is located just outside of Moab on the road to Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands Island in the Sky District. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles, year round, via a paved highway. From Moab head north out of town on U.S. Highway 191. Cross the bridge over the Colorado River. After crossing the bridge continue north for 8.3 miles to the junction with State Road 313, signed Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands. Turn west (left) on State Road 313 and follow it for 2.7 miles to mile marker 19.8. There is a small pull-out on the north (right) side of the road that will accommodate a couple of vehicles. This is the trailhead. Route Information: From the trailhead walk 20-yards north to the base of the cliff. The Intestine Man Pictograph Panel (N38° 38' 55\", W109° 43'29\") is rather small and located approximately 25-feet above ground level. It is easily visible from the road. A pair of binoculars will allow you to see the details of Intestine man without having to do any exposed climbing up the face of the cliff. The TV Sheep Petroglyph Panel (N38° 38' 56\", W109° 43' 26\") is located 20-yards east (right) of Intestine Man. It is easily visible from the road. The panel has several big horn sheep and what appears to be a fox with a trackway. Several other entertaining figures can also be found on the panel. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

This is a fun technical canyoneering route that contains several amazing petroglyph panels, combined with a nice shaded approach hike, some fun minor scrambling, and several entertaining rappels. General Information: Lizard Country is a technical canyoneering route that contains several entertaining rappels and some interesting rock art. Lizard Country requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 hours. Lizard Country is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is accessible year round, but the route would not be enjoyable during the hot summer month's. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. In normal conditions this canyon does not require any swimming or wading. The route contains several rappels with the longest being 120-feet. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Navigation for this route is moderate. The route does traverse through some major areas of cryptobiotic soil that can be avoided with a little care. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has an extremely small flash flood danger. Trailhead Information: The Lizard Country Trailhead is accessible year round to all vehicles. Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the corner of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 3.6 miles to a gravel spur road (N38° 32' 53\", W109° 35' 35\"), which climbs south from the east (left) side of Kane Creek Drive. Follow the spur road 200-yards to the top of the cut. This is the Lizard Country Trailhead. This is also the trailhead for both Mastodon Canyon and Upper Cut Canyon. The trailhead is identified by a private residence located 50-yards south of the trailhead. What appears to be a large parking lot is actually half public and half private, stay as far away from the private residence as possible and you will be on public land. Please be considerate of the residence privacy when visiting so we don't lose this access. There is parking for several vehicles at the trailhead. Route Information: From the Lizard Country Trailhead (N38° 32' 47\", W109° 35' 35\"), follow the power lines north (towards Moab). Walk the power line maintenance road that follows roughly beneath the power lines. After hiking along the maintenance road for 1/3 mile you can see the Moab Mastodon, also known as the Moab Mammoth Petroglyph, (N38° 32' 57\", W109° 35' 21\") at the base of a massive cliff on the east (right) side of the maintenance road. The petroglyph is easily visible from the maintenance road. Walk over and enjoy your visit. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/lizard.htm 1/25/2018 Lizard Country - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 From the Moab Mastodon Petroglyph Panel follow the base of the cliff south (right) for 150-yards to the impressive Four-Toed Petroglyph Panel (N38° 32' 54\", W109° 35' 19\"). If you keep a sharp look-out you will see other rock art between the two panels. The Four-Toed Petroglyph Panel is the most impressive rock art in the immediate area. While viewing the Four- Toed Petroglyph Panel look on the ground where you are standing and you will find more petroglyphs. From the Four-Toed Petroglyph Panel just keep following the cliff wall southeast and you will soon find yourself climbing up Mastodon Canyon. The big advantage of using this canyon to access Behind The Rocks is the approach is in the shade for most of the morning. There is nothing difficult with climbing up this canyon. You will have to scramble up over some small ledges but nothing complicated. A social trail is beginning to develop in the canyon which makes hiking up it easier. Just keep following the water course east and stay in the drainage to avoid cryptobiotic soil and you will eventually pop out the top of the canyon (N38° 32' 48\", W109° 34' 56\"). At the top of the canyon you can turn southeast across slickrock. For the next 1/2 mile you will have to zig-zag to avoid the cryptobiotic soil. The weaving and backtracking becomes a lot more fun if you make a game out of it, with a little care and effort you can avoid all the cryptobiotic soil. After 1/2 mile of playing avoid the crypto you will reach a 90-foot rappel (N38° 32' 35\", W109° 34' 48\"), that is anchored from a tree. The rappel deposits you in a minor drainage. From the bottom of the rappel just follow the drainage southeast a short distance and you will intersect Sunseed Canyon (N38° 32' 31\", W109° 34' 45\"). As you enter Sunseed you are presented with a 30-foot wall that can be rappelled using a small tree as your anchor, or simply downclimb using a ledge system to the west (right). Once in the bottom of the Sunseed drainage just follow it downstream, in a southwest direction, bypassing minor obstacles as they present themselves. Soon you will reach a 20-foot drop (N38° 32' 28\", W109° 34' 47\") that can be downclimbed, handlined or rappelled. The downclimb is not as hard as it looks, but if you want to rappel the drop you will need to establish an anchor. Using your best climber as an anchor and than spotting him from below as he downclimbs is a popular option for defeating this obstacle. From the bottom of the 20-foot drop you will be presented with what appears to be a huge drop (N38° 32' 27\", W109° 34' 51\"). The good part about this huge drop is it can be broken into two-stages. The upper stage is 120-feet down to a ledge and is anchored by two bolts on the south (left) canyon wall. The bottom portion of the upper rappel is free-hanging. The bad part about this rappel is you must extend the rappel anchor over the edge or you will not be able to retrieve your ropes from below. This makes the start of the rappel a little scary. The best option is to anchor the ropes up high near the bolts for everyone in the group to create and easy start to the rappel. The last person down can extend the webbing over the edge and be protected from a fall by the group below using a fireman's belay. If you do not take the time to properly anchor this rappel and create a smooth rope pull you might find yourself stranded on the mid-point ledge. The mid-point ledge is an interesting place. The ledge is large enough to comfortably fit a party of 6 or more, but the ledge is exposed. The ledge is about 3-feet wide and 20-feet long and the upper rappel deposits you right in the middle of it. Pictures of this ledge make it look a lot scarier than it actually is, there is plenty of room to work with. The second stage of this rappel is much easier. The second stage is 100-feet and is anchored by two bolts at the south (left) end of the ledge. the bolts are located next to a small tree and create a straightforward rappel down to the canyon floor. Once on the canyon floor simply hike down the stunning canyon. As you exit the canyon you will encounter some overhead power lines. Follow the power lines north (right) until you stumble upon the power line maintenance road. Scramble down to the maintenance road and the trailhead from which you began your adventure. Do not continue hiking west beyond the power lines trying to reach Kane Creek Road as you will be on private property and trespassing. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/lizard.htm 1/25/2018 Lizard Country - Moab - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 Cryptobiotic Soil: Follow the route described and please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires years of undisturbed growth before it becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth.

The route involves just enough hiking to keep things interesting. This is a must-do route for rock art enthusiasts. General Information: The Moab Maiden, sometimes called the Moab Princess, is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours in Moab away from the normal tourist routes. The petroglyph is a single figure in a fascinating location. A round trip to the Moab Maiden requires approximately 1 to 2 hours, which includes time to enjoy and explore. The route requires some very short sections of steep hiking but no major rock scrambling or other obstacles. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The Moab Maiden Petroglyph is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. The high cliff across Kane Creek from the Moab Maiden, known as Tombstone, is frequented by BASE jumpers. If they are jumping this a fun place to watch from. Nearby camping is available at Moonflower Canyon 1/2 mile away. Trailhead Information: This short hike is located just outside of Moab. The trailhead is accessible year round to all vehicles. Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the corner of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 4.7 miles to where the pavement ends at a cattle guard (N38° 32' 03\", W109° 36' 00\"). From the cattle guard follow the well maintained gravel road southwest for 200-yards to a very large parking area on the west (right) side of the road. This is the trailhead for the Moab Maiden. The trailhead is easy to identify as it contains parking for several dozen vehicles. There is a kiosk and the trailhead is signed Jackson Hole Trail. Route Information: The first part of this hike follow the Jackson Hole Trail. From the Jackson Hole Trailhead (N38° 31' 57\", W109° 36' 01\") which begins at the south end of the parking area, follow the Jackson Hole Trail 100-yards as it makes a short descent down to and crosses Kane Creek. After crossing Kane Creek keep following the trail for an additional 150-yards to a junction (N38° 31' 52\", W109° 35' 57\"), where a small use trail leads south (left), up the steep hillside. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/maiden.htm 1/25/2018 Moab Maiden - Petroglyph - Moab Page 2 of 2 Follow the small use trail 100-yards up the steep hill to a second junction (N38° 31' 50\", W109° 36' 01\") located in the middle of a patch of slickrock. This second junction is tricky to identify because it is located in the middle of a patch of slickrock. The trail appears to cross the slickrock and continue west, but that is not he way you want to go. From the middle of the slickrock hike south (left), up the shallow watercourse a short distance and you will find a hiker trail continuing on after the slickrock ends. From the south end of the slickrock just follow the easy to identify hiker trail as it climbs south, up through a cliff band to a large flat plateau and the Moab Maiden (N38° 31' 46\", W109° 35' 55\"). The Moab Maiden is located on the backside (west side) of the large rock just as the trail reaches the top of the plateau. When you are viewing the Moab Maiden Kane Creek will be in front of you and the Colorado River will be to your left. It's not difficult to locate. Video: Enjoy a short video of the Moab Maiden Petroglyph. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

The petroglyph is sometimes called the Moab Mastodon. Scientists disagree on whether the woolly mammoth never roamed Utah or not, but this interesting petroglyph hints that humans and mammoth once shared the area. The Four-Toed Petroglyph Panel is included in this family friendly adventure. General Information: Moab Mammoth is a fun way to spend an hour near Moab. The panel contains a large mammoth and several other interesting figures. The Four-Toed Petroglyph Panel is located along the route and contains what appears to be a giant bear, several anthropomorphic (human) figures, big horn sheep and other figures. A round trip to both petroglyph panels requires approximately 1 hour. The route requires only easy walking and no scrambling over rocks. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Moab Mammoth is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Nearby camping is available at Moonflower Canyon 1/2 mile away. Trailhead Information: This short hike is located just outside of Moab near Kane Creek. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles, year round, via a paved highway. Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the corner of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 3.6 miles to a gravel spur road (N38° 32' 53\", W109° 35' 35\"), which climbs south from the east (left) side of Kane Creek Drive. Follow the spur road 200-yards to the top of the cut. This is the trailhead. The trailhead is identified by a private residence located 50-yards south of the trailhead. What appears to be a large parking lot is actually half public and half private, stay as far away from the private residence as possible and you will be on public land. Please be considerate of the residence privacy when visiting so we don't lose this access. There is parking for several vehicles at the trailhead.

After hiking along the maintenance road for 1/3 mile you can see the Moab Mammoth Petroglyph (N38° 32' 57\", W109° 35' 21\") at the base of a massive cliff on the east http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/mammoth.htm 1/25/2018 Moab Mammoth - Petroglyph - Moab Page 2 of 2 (right) side of the maintenance road. The petroglyph is easily visible from the maintenance road. Walk over and enjoy your visit. From the Moab Mammoth Petroglyph Panel follow the base of the cliff south (right) for 150-yards to the impressive Four-Toed Petroglyph Panel (N38° 32' 54\", W109° 35' 19\"). If you keep a sharp look-out you will see other rock art between the two panels. The Four-Toed Petroglyph Panel is the most impressive rock art in the immediate area. While viewing the Four- Toed Petroglyph Panel look on the ground where you are standing and you will find more petroglyphs. Video: Enjoy a short video of the Moab Mammoth Petroglyph. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

This route is a major improvement over the traditional Moonflower Canyon technical route. General Information: Mastodon Canyon is a technical canyoneering route that contains a dramatic 197-foot rappel. This rappel can unnerve even experienced canyoneers as you literally step off into space. The views are dramatic. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 hours. Mastodon Canyon requires complete technical gear. Mastodon Canyon is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is accessible year round, but the route would not be enjoyable during the hot summer month's. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. Navigation for this route is moderate. The route does traverse through some major areas of cryptobiotic soil that can be easily avoided with a little care. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has an extremely small flash flood danger. In normal conditions this canyon does not require any swimming or wading. The route contains one mandatory rappel that is exactly 197-feet from anchor to ground. Make certain your rope is not short or you will be in big trouble. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. This is a route where radio's are a big help because it's nearly impossible to communicate from the top of the big rappel to the bottom because of the echo's in the canyon. Normally I'm not a huge fan of gloves, but they are advised for the big rappel as I think they add a margin of safety. The anchors in this canyon are all bolted and easy to locate. Trailhead Information: The Mastodon Trailhead is accessible year round to all vehicles. Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the corner of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 3.6 miles to a gravel spur road (N38° 32' 53\", W109° 35' 35\"), which climbs south from the east (left) side of Kane Creek Drive. Follow the spur road 200-yards to the top of the cut. This is the Mastodon Trailhead. This is also the trailhead for Lizard Country and Upper Cut Canyon. The trailhead is identified by a private residence located 50-yards south of the trailhead. What appears to be a large parking lot is actually half public and half private, stay as far away from the private residence as possible and you will be on public land. Please be considerate of the residence privacy when visiting so we don't lose this access. There is parking for several vehicles at the trailhead. Route Information: From the Mastodon Trailhead (N38° 32' 47\", W109° 35' 35\"), follow the power lines north (towards Moab). Walk the power line maintenance road that follows roughly beneath the power lines. After hiking along the maintenance road for 1/3 mile you can see the Moab http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/mastodon.htm 1/25/2018 Mastodon Canyon - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Mastodon, also known as the Moab Mammoth Petroglyph, (N38° 32' 57\", W109° 35' 21\") at the base of a massive cliff on the east (right) side of the maintenance road. The petroglyph is easily visible from the maintenance road. Walk over and enjoy your visit. From the Moab Mastodon Petroglyph Panel follow the base of the cliff south (right) for 150-yards to the impressive Four-Toed Petroglyph Panel (N38° 32' 54\", W109° 35' 19\"). If you keep a sharp look-out you will see other rock art between the two panels. The Four-Toed Petroglyph Panel is the most impressive rock art in the immediate area. While viewing the Four- Toed Petroglyph Panel look on the ground where you are standing and you will find more petroglyphs. From the Four-Toed Petroglyph Panel just keep following the cliff wall southeast and you will soon find yourself climbing up Mastodon Canyon. The big advantage of using this canyon to access Behind The Rocks is the approach is in the shade for most of the morning. There is nothing difficult with climbing up this canyon. You will have to scramble up over some small ledges but nothing complicated. A social trail is beginning to develop in the canyon which makes hiking up it easier. Just keep following the water course east and stay in the drainage to avoid cryptobiotic soil and you will eventually pop out the top of the canyon (N38° 32' 51\", W109° 34' 45\"), where you can turn north across slickrock. Hike north for 300-yards and you will encounter an old 4x4 track (N38° 32' 57\", W109° 34' 43\"). The track is faint and not easy to see, but once you locate the 4x4 track it makes the next 1/2 mile of hiking north much easier. Soon you will encounter the Moonflower Canyon drainage (N38° 33' 15\", W109° 34' 36\"). Hike west down the Moonflower drainage and the sandstone walls will begin to rise immediately. You will encounter a couple of potholes and pools that are easily bypassed. Soon you will reach a 10-foot drop into a large pool surrounded by willows. This drop can be downclimbed by the skilled or rappelled by a single bolt on the north (right) that allows you to miss the pool and keep from getting wet. Immediately past the 10-foot drop the bottom falls out of the earth and you are presented with a butt clinching 197-foot free hanging rappel (N38° 33' 15\", W109° 34' 46\"). Make certain your ropes are not short before you commit to this rappel. The rappel is anchored by two bolts on the north (right) canyon wall. Make certain your webbing extends 15-feet from the bolts to create a good pull for your ropes, to avoid rope grooves in the sandstone and the make certain your ropes reach the canyon floor. I also recommend you do not toss your rope from the top but instead let it just slide over the edge of the cliff. The reason for this is a tree is located right at the bottom of the rappel and if you throw your ropes out over the edge they have a habit of becoming tangled in the top of the tree. If you just let your rope slide over the edge of the drop this should not be an issue. From the bottom of the rappel walk down the west (left) rim of the canyon until you are under the power lines. From there just follow the power line maintenance road southwest (left) for 1/2 mile back to the Mastodon Trailhead. Cryptobiotic Soil: Follow the route described and please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires years of undisturbed growth before it becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth.

The route contains a rappel into a short, interesting slot and a spectacular, free air rappel from the top of Morning Glory Arch. In normal conditions the route is dry. Some pictures on this page were taken during a massive rainstorm. This route is accessible year round, during all weather conditions. General Information: Medieval Chamber is a technical canyoneering adventure. This adventure will require 3 hours to complete. You will need one 60-meter rope, 100-feet of webbing and a 5/16 rapid-link. I also recommend carrying several slings. There are two 100' rappels. Under normal conditions this route is dry. You might encounter some ankle deep wading during wet conditions. A large size group is not a problem with this route. Medieval Chamber is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. The route is easy to navigate. A GPS is extremely useful in identifying waypoints on the cross-country trek to reach the top of Medieval Camber. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5 minute topographical maps \"Moab\" and \"Rill Creek\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a small flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to this canyon. If you are advanced canyoneers and intend to simultaneous rappel from Morning Glory Arch you will need two 50-meter ropes. This is a technique that should only be attempted by experienced canyoneers. Failure to execute this technique properly has a high probability of killing both you and your partner. You have been warned! Canyon History: The Negro Bill Canyon was rename Grandstaff Canyon in October 2017. Depending on how old your maps and information are you might find either of the names Negro Bill Canyon or Grandstaff Canyon used, it's good to know whichever name is used it's still the same canyon. The canyon was named after Bill (William) Granstaff, a black cowboy and prospector who ran cattle in the desert canyon in the late 1870s with a Canadian trapper named \"Frenchie\". Granstaff fled the area in 1881 after being charged with bootlegging whiskey to the Indians. His guilt or innocence in the matter was never determined. Until the early 1970s, the canyon was named 'Nigger Bill Canyon'. Fee Information: A Sand Flats Permit is required to enter the Sand Flats Recreational Area (SFRA), which includes the Medieval Camber canyoneering route. Grandstaff Canyon Trailhead: The first step of this adventure is to leave a shuttle vehicle at the Grandstaff Canyon Trailhead. Drive north out of Moab on highway 191 approximately 1 mile to highway http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/medieval.htm 1/25/2018 Medieval Chamber - Moab Utah - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 128. Drive east on highway 128 for 3 miles to the signed Grandstaff Canyon Trailhead. Leave your shuttle vehicle here. Medieval Camber Trailhead: From the Grandstaff Canyon Trailhead take highway 191 back to the center of Moab. Turn east on Mill Creek Road and follow it until the Y with Sand Flats Road. Follow Sand flats Road to the \"Slickrock\" mountain biking trailhead. You will pass through a fee and information station where you will be charged a small fee. From the \"Slickrock\" mountain bike parking lot continue traveling east on Sand Flats Road for 1 1/2 miles. There is a parking area near where the road crosses the drainage pipe. Park anywhere in this area. Route Information: From the Medieval Trailhead (N38 35' 02\", W109 29' 34\") walk into the major drainage leading north. All the drainage's in this area flow north and soon join up so it is hard to get lost. Follow the drainage north for 1 1/2 miles enjoying your stroll through the beautiful desert. Eventually the drainage reaches a dryfall which leads into the heart of the Medieval Chamber (N38 35' 33\", W109 30' 29\"). The first rappel is 100' and the rappel anchors are located just north of the watercourse at the dryfall headwall. The anchor consists of two bolts with hangers. Enjoy your time in Medieval Chamber, it is very short but interesting. A brief distance after exiting Medieval Chamber you will discover you are standing above Morning Glory Arch, which is misnamed because it is really a Bridge. This is a great spot to rest or enjoy lunch. There are several ways to reach the canyon floor from Morning Glory Arch. I will describe the simplest method, more advanced canyoneers can test there skills using other methods. DO NOT place bolts in the top of Morning Glory Arch. There is a large juniper tree about 40' from the lip of the dry fall on the left (LDC) side of the watercourse. Use this tree, webbing and a 5/16 rapid-link to create a rappel anchor. We extended the rappel anchor 40' from the tree with webbing. This created an easy rope pull and allowed us to rappel using a single 60 meter rope. There are normally hikers lounging at the base of Morning Glory Arch, please you care to insure their safety from falling objects. From the bottom of Morning Glory Arch hike downstream 1/2 mile to where the trail joins the main drainage of Grandstaff Canyon (N38 35' 51\", W109 30' 49\"). From the junction continue following the well-established trail down Grandstaff Canyon to the Colorado River and your shuttle car at the Grandstaff Canyon Trailhead (N38 36' 36\", W109 32' 01\"). Optional Loop Route: For those without a shuttle vehicle a loop route is available. The first part of the route is identical to the standard route listed above. The variation begins after your final rappel from the top of Morning Glory Arch. From the bottom of Morning Glory Arch hike downstream 1/2 mile to where the trail joins the main drainage of Grandstaff Canyon (N38 35' 51\", W109 30' 49\"). At the main drainage turn east and hike upstream following the trail closet to the stream for 1 1/4 miles to where a weakness in the south canyon wall appears (N38 35' 51\", W109 29' 42\"). Scramble south up through the weakness and you will be able to intercept an ATV trail (N38 35' 38\", W109 29' 46\") in 3/4 miles. Follow the ATV trail south for 3/4 miles and it will lead you back to the Medieval Chamber Trailhead.

Its amazing to see this lush paradise in the middle of miles of red rock. General Information: The North Fork of Mill Creek Canyon is a fun hike up a beautiful canyon with a warm clear flowing stream. The route can be enjoyed by any healthy adult or child. No special gear is required other than footwear suitable for walking in water and minor scrambling over slickrock. Most groups will want to bring clothing suitable for swimming to maximize the fun meter. The complete hike involves walking approximately 2 miles each way. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead can range anywhere from a couple of hours to a full day. This canyon and its swimming holes are extremely popular with the locals. Mill Creek is rated 1C I using the Canyon Rating System. In normal conditions the route will contain several sections of wading. But bring your swimming suit because the most fun is had by swimming across the pools as you make your way along the stream. A GPS is extremely useful in locating the petroglyphs and pictographs. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Moab\" and \"Rill Creek\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Mill Creek use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: From 300 South and Main Street in Moab. Turn east on 300 South and follow it 4 blocks to where it tee's into 400 East. Turn south (right) and follow 400 East for 100 yards to Mill Creek Drive. Turn east (left) on Mill Creek Drive and follow it 0.5 miles to a 3-way stop. At the 3-way stop you must turn south (right) to continue following Mill Creek Road. From the 3-Way stop follow Mill Creek Road an additional 0.5 miles to Power House Road. Turn east (left) on Power House Road and follow it 0.7 miles to the Mill Creek Trailhead. The trailhead is identified by a large dirt parking area with an information kiosk on the east side. There are no restrooms at the Mill Creek Trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: From the Mill Creek Trailhead (N38° 33' 43\", W109° 31' 02\"), follow the well defined trail east as it makes its way upstream. After hiking approximately 3/4 miles the canyon splits. Take the north (left) fork and keep hiking upstream. About 100-yards after the canyon splits you will see several large boulders on the south (right) side of the canyon on a ledge about 10 feet above the stream. These large boulders (N38° 33' 49\", W109° 30' 22\") are covered with numerous interesting petroglyphs. 250 yards upstream from the large petroglyph boulders you will encounter the main and most popular of the many swimming holes (N38° 33' 51\", W109° 30' 13\") along the North Fork http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/mill.htm 1/25/2018 Mill Creek North Fork - Moab - Swimming Hole and Petroglyphs Page 2 of 2 of Mill Creek. This swimming hole usually attracts a young crowd that entertains each other by jumping off the high surrounding cliffs. The more adult crowd generally continues strolling up canyon enjoying the beautiful stream as it cascades through the lush vegetation. The second major swimming hole (N38° 34' 04\", W109° 29' 44\") is located 1/2 mile above the first main swimming hole. The second swimming hole is actually bigger and makes a better pool then the first. The second pool has a tendency to attract a more leisurely crowd. There is a really nice petroglyph panel of three big horn sheep (N38° 34' 09\", W109° 29' 49\") located 200 yards north of the second swimming hole. The panel is located on the north wall at the base of the cliff. After visiting the big horn sheep panel continue hiking upstream for 1/3 mile following the social trails along the north wall and you will encounter a large alcove. Inside the large alcove is the Many Hands Pictograph Panel (N38° 34' 17\", W109° 29' 30\"). The pictograph panel consists of many hands and several other figures. Please do not touch the rock art. The canyon contains many other items of interest for those willing to explore. Video: Here is an exciting high definition video from Mill Creek that consists mainly of young men who have yet to discover that they are not indestructible. Yes, I know some of you think it's irresponsible of me to post this type of video, and that makes me feel bad. Well, not really, but if I were a good person I would feel bad. If you get hurt jumping or diving its your own fault, it is a dangerous activity. If you feel the need to contact me further over the posting of this video please visit my Nigerian lawyer. I paid him a very large retainer for just such an eventuality. Caution: Sections of this route pass near gardens of poison ivy. The poison ivy is easy to avoid if you know what it looks like. Poison ivy has three leaves and is frequently found near water. Poison ivy leaves are green in the summer and red in the fall. Educate yourself before attempting this route.

It's a quaint canyon and has several redeeming qualities, foremost of which is it visits a very isolated region of Arches National Park along with Covert Arch. This is a nice canyon to try if you are in the area. General Information: MMI Canyon is a technical canyoneering route that is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 4 hours. MMI Canyon requires complete technical gear. MMI Canyon is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. You will need an Arches Canyoneering Permit to enter MMI Canyon. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. This canyon is accessible year round provided there is no snow on the ground. The exit for this route might be impossible if there is snow on north facing slopes. The route would not be at it's best during the hot summer month's. This canyon should be dry in almost all weather conditions. No wading or swimming is required. The route contains three rappels. The longest rappel is 200-feet. Two 200-foot ropes are required. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Navigation for this route is moderate. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Cisco SW\" and \"Mollie Hogans\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: While this route is located inside Arches National Park it's a long drive to the trailhead because the route is located on the backside of Arches National Park. A four wheel drive is recommended as the roads are often covered with blow sand. The roads are not hardcore four wheeling, but you might encounter short sandy sections in normal driving conditions. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Green River, Utah: Travel east for 18 miles to Crescent Junction (where I-70 meets Highway 191). From Moab, Utah: Travel north on Highway 191 for 30 miles to Crescent Junction (where I-70 meets Highway 191). From Crescent Junction: Follow I-70 east for 11 miles to Exit 193 (N38° 56' 32\", W109° 36' 53\"), signed Yellow Cat. Exit I-70 and turn south. Follow the graded Yellow Cat Road southeast for 6.2 miles to a fork (N38° 52' 04\", W109° 33' 00\"). Take the east (left) fork. Continue following the road for 2.1 miles to the Yellow Cat Mine Ruins (N38° 50' 53\", W109° 31' 42\"). The ruins are located on the east side of the road. From The Yellow Cat Mine Ruins follow the road east for 1.0 mile to a fork (N38° 51' 01\", W109° 30' 38\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 2.6 miles to a fork (N38° 49' 27\", W109° 29' 48\"). Take the east (left) fork and follow the road 3.1 miles to a junction (N38° http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/mmi.htm 1/25/2018 MMI Canyon - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 48' 31\", W109° 26' 53\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 1.2 miles to a junction (N38° 47' 51\", W109° 26' 06\"), with a less traveled road heading west (right). Carefully driven passenger vehicles and high clearance vehicles can normally reach this junction without problems, beyond this point the roads might contain sections of sand. Follow the less traveled road west for 2.9 miles to where a fence crosses the road. This is the MMI Canyon Trailhead. Park next to the fence in what is starting to develop into a small parking area. This is also the trailhead for the exciting Undercover Canyon. Route Information: From the MMI Canyon Trailhead (N38° 46' 46\", W109° 28' 54\"), hike 1/3 mile northwest to the head of MMI canyon (N38° 46' 53\", W109° 29' 15\"). The head of the canyon contains two prongs; make certain you are in the north prong. You will find a nice ramp tucked into the corner of the north prong. You need to scramble down this ramp to a stack of boulders, which are the rappel anchor for the first rappel. Everyone in your group can rappel 200-feet to the floor of the canyon. The last person down might find it advantages to stop the rappel short, pull the ropes and downclimb the final section. Or you might find it better to re-rig the initial anchor to a better location, because right now the rope pull for this rappel sucks. From the bottom of the first rappel continue downstream, past the junction with the south prong, to the second rappel. This rappel is 15-feet and is anchored from a tree. From the bottom of the second rappel continue downstream to the third and final rappel. The final rappel is 100- feet and is anchored from a tree. After the final rappel continue hiking downstream and enjoy the view. As the canyon begins to open up you will encounter a small drainage entering from the south (left) side of the canyon, this is the exit (N38° 46' 59\", W109° 30' 05\"). Locating the correct small drainage might be difficult when hiking down canyon, but if you reach a major drainage known as Undercover Canyon entering from the north (right), you have gone too far and need to reverse your route and hike back upstream 150-yards to locate the small drainage. Hike up the small drainage to the slickrock, and then continue up the slickrock a short distance until it begins to get steep. The key to the exit is to traverse east (left) approximately 40 yards to a small ledge or seam. You can walk up the slickrock along the seam. This will get you over the steep section of slickrock and allow you to snake your way up the slickrock taking the path of least resistance. You will eventual reach an interesting, 3-foot wide, flat section called \"The Sidewalk\". The Sidewalk is located at the base of the next steep section of slickrock. At this point your eyes will tell you to go east (left), but that is wrong. Follow the Sidewalk west (right) and enjoy strolling along a really cool natural feature. In several places it will appear that The Sidewalk is about to end but it doesn't, just keep following The Sidewalk around a corner to where you can easily exit through the capstone to the canyon rim (N38° 46' 54\", W109° 30' 14\"). Once on top of the canyon rim you will want to visit the impressive Covert Arch (N38° 46' 55\", W109° 30' 22\"). Hike west 200-yards and you will be standing right on top of the arch. It's easy to walk right over the top of the arch and completely miss it if you are not paying attention to its location. From the top of Covert Arch hike 1 1/4 miles in a southeast direction to intersect a 4x4 road (N38° 46' 26\", W109° 29' 17\"). Intersecting the road makes hiking through the sand much easier. Once you intersect the road just follow it northeast for 1/2 mile back to the trailhead. Covert Arch Statistics: Greater Arch Dimension (GAD): 60 feet. For this arch, the LAD is its span. Lesser Arch Dimension (LAD): 32 feet. For this arch, the GAD is its height.

I have never before found rock art in such a unique and interesting location. General Information: The Moab Grotto is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours near Moab away from the normal tourist routes. The route contains numerous pictographs hidden inside an amazing little slot canyon. A trip to the Moab Grotto requires approximately 2 hours, which includes plenty of time to enjoy and explore. A round trip requires 1/2 mile of easy hiking each way. The route contains no major rock scrambling or other obstacles. The rock art is accessible year round in dry weather conditions. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Dee Pass\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The Moab Grotto Pictograph Panel is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: This short hike is located just outside of Moab. The trailhead is accessible year round to all vehicles in dry weather conditions. This area is crisscrossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off. From the bridge over the Colorado River, just outside Moab, drive north on Highway 191 for approximately 14 miles to mile marker 142.7. There is a dirt road on the west (left) side of the highway signed \"Blue Hills Road\" (N38° 44' 53\", W109° 44' 17\"). Follow the Blue Hills Road dirt road west for 7.1 miles to a junction signed with a \"T\" (N38° 46' 57\", W109° 50' 54\"). Continue straight-ahead (northwest) at this junction and drive an addition 0.3 miles to a second junction signed with a \"T\" (N38° 47' 05\", W109° 51' 05\"). Turn west (left) at the second junction and follow the dirt road west for 1.7 miles to a third junction (N38° 47' 01\", W109° 52' 49\"). Turn south (left) at the third junction and follow the dirt road south for 0.1 miles to the Moab Grotto Trailhead. The trailhead is not signed but it is easy to identify as the road ends at a BLM barrier. There is parking for several vehicles. Route Information: From the Moab Grotto Trailhead (N38° 46' 57\", W109° 52' 46\"), follow the trail south for 1/3 mile and it will lead you to the very large and prominent Pictograph Rock (N38° 46' 41\", W109° 52' 58\"). This outcropping of rock contains numerous pictographs and petroglyphs if you search. The largest concentration of rock art is located under the ledges on the south side of the rock and are painted on the ceiling of the small alcoves. You have to bend over and look up to find them. There is also a large concentration of rock art in one of the slots on the east end of the rock outcropping. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/moabgrotto.htm 1/25/2018 Moab Grotto Pictograph Panel - Rock Art - Moab Page 2 of 2 From Pictograph Rock you must hike 200-yards south to located the Moab Grotto (N38° 46' 35\", W109° 52' 58\").

Canyon Arches National Park Technical Canyoneering Not Tierdrop is an entertaining technical canyoneering route in Arches National Park. The route provides outstanding views of Park Avenue from above. As with many of the Moab area canyons the route is best described as a enchanting excursion. General Information: Not Tierdrop is best described as a short but fun technical route. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 hours. Not Tierdrop requires complete technical gear. The scenery is dramatic. Not Tierdrop is rated 3A I using the Canyon Rating System. You will need an Arches Canyoneering Permit to enter Tierdrop Canyon. In normal conditions the route should be dry. There are several rappels in the canyon with the highest being 100-feet. But because of the long rope pulls required to reach useable natural anchors two 60-meter ropes and a minimum of 100-feet of webbing are required, the innovative will probably be able to get by with less. The rappels are easy to rig using a large amount of rope and webbing, but are more difficult to rig using little or no webbing. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"The Windows Section\" and \"Moab\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Not Tierdrop use the WGS84 datum. This route has an extremely minor flash flood danger. This canyon is accessible year round, unless snow is on the ground. The route would be miserable during the hot part of the summer day. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. It is of value to note that Tierdrop, Not Tierdrop and U-Turn all use the same trailhead. This makes completing a combo platter of any combination of the canyons easy to complete in a single day. Trailhead Information: From Arches National Park Visitor Center drive into the park for 2.1 miles to the signed Park Avenue Trailhead and Viewpoint. Park in the large, paved, parking lot on the north (left) side of the road. The trailhead easily accommodates a large number of vehicles. There is no restroom at the trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: From the Park Avenue Trailhead and Viewpoint (N38° 37' 27\", W109° 36' 00\") walk west on the main road for about 75-yards to a combination small wash and use trail on the north side of the road. Follow the use trail west to the back corner of the massive cliffs. Hidden in the corner you will find the crack approach (N38° 37' 24\", W109° 36' 17\"). Scramble up the crack to the small saddle (N38° 37' 26\", W109° 36' 20\"). From the top of the saddle look north and you will see an obvious notch on the left (Tierdrop Canyon), a sandstone dome in the middle, and Not- Tierdrop Canyon on the right. To reach Not Tierdrop, follow a northern circular route on slickrock around the cryptobiotic soil to the dome. Please try and minimize damage to the cryptobiotic soil. Once you reach the dome route find your way to the east (right) side of the dome. On the east side of the dome, you will discover a 15-foot solution pocketed wall that you must scramble up. Not Tierdrop begins at the top of the solution pocketed wall (N38° 37' 30\", W109° 36' 19\"). From the top of the solution pocketed wall you are looking down Not Tierdrop. The first rappel is 100-feet high, but the common anchor is the tree at the base of the solution pocketed wall. Using the tree as an anchor requires two 60-meter ropes and about 70-feet of webbing. Those with advanced anchor skills will easily find better options requiring less rope and webbing. From the bottom of the first rappel, you will immediately encounter a two-stage rappel anchored by a cairn (stack of rocks). The first stage is 30- feet and the second stage is 40-feet. These rappels can be done separately but most groups prefer to chain them together. If you chain the rappels together please use care when pulling your ropes to avoid rope groves in the sandstone. From the bottom of the two-stage rappel hike down a dirt slope, following a developing social trail, that provides access to a ledge system. Follow the ledge system north (left) as it circles around to the head of the main watercourse (Tierdrop Canyon) to a simple downclimb that provides access to the bottom of the canyon. From the bottom of the simple downclimb just hike east a short distance until you intersect the Park Avenue hikers trail (N38° 37' 43\", W109° 36' 05\"). At the hiker trail turn south (right) and follow it back to the Park Avenue Trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/nottierdrop.htm 1/25/2018 Not Tierdrop - Arches National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 Cryptobiotic Soil: Follow the route described and you will avoid areas of cryptobiotic crust. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

The area is off the radar of the normal Moab tourist so finding a little seclusion is not difficult. The rock is a brilliant deep red and the massive canyon walls tower over your head. This is a great hike that all fit adults and children should be able to enjoy. General Information: Onion Creek is an amazing area that is fun to explore. This route is rated 2A III using the Canyon Rating System. You can spend several hours or a complete day in the different drainage's depending on how much you want to explore. This hike is easily accessible year round. This canyon can be brutally hot in summer. During hot weather an early morning hike is recommended. Every member of your hiking party should carry at least one liter of water. This canyon usually has flowing water in several sections. Keeping your feet dry is not difficult. There are several obstacles in the canyon that you will be required to scramble over, none of these obstacles should stop your average physically fit hiker. Navigation for this hike is Moderate. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Fisher Towers\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for Onion Creek use the WGS84 datum. This route has a moderate flash flood danger. Trailhead Information: Drive north out of Moab on Highway 191 approximately 2 miles to the junction with Highway 128. Drive east on Highway 128, along the Colorado River, for 20 miles to the signed \"Onion Creek\" turn-off located at mile marker 20.1 on the south (right) side of the highway. Turn south on the grated Onion Creek Road. Follow the Onion Creek Road south for 3.9 miles to the Onion Creek Trailhead. The road crosses Onion Creek numerous times before reaching the trailhead. The trailhead is easy to located, After crossing the only bridge in the canyon the Onion Creek Trailhead is located at the next stream crossing. There is a small pull-out on the south (right) side of the road that will accommodate several vehicles. High clearance vehicles, four wheel drives and rental cars should have no problem reaching the trailhead in normal conditions. Passenger cars will have trouble reaching this trailhead but might be able to if carefully driven. There are numerous BLM campsites located along Onion Creek. Portable toilets are required for those camping along Onion Creek. Route Information: From the Onion Creek Trailhead (N38° 42' 22\", W109° 18' 13\") you will notice that three drainage's join up right where the road crosses the stream and things are a little confusing. The main fork of Onion Creek flows along the south side of the road. The tributary you want to hike up is the wide drainage on the North side of the road. There is also an inviting looking slot entering from the north that is guarded by several trees, this is not the correct drainage and contains an insurmountable dryfall a couple hundred yards up canyon. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/onion.htm 1/25/2018 Onion Creek - Moab Page 2 of 2 Begin hiking up the wide drainage on the north side of the Onion Creek Road. The drainage travels east for a short distance before turning north and heading back into the beautiful Mystery Towers area. 3/4 miles after leaving the trailhead you will encounter the North Fork Junction (N38° 42' 36\", W109° 17' 39\"). Turn north (left) to visit the North Fork of Onion Creek or keep hiking straight an additional 1/2 mile to reach the Middle Fork/East Fork Junction (N38° 42' 52\", W109° 17' 15\"). North Fork: The North Fork of Onion Creek is fun to explore and you can hike up it approximately 3/4 miles above the junction. For those who really like to explore you can climb out of the canyon in several places. Hike out of the canyon to the west and you will eventually intersect the Fisher Towers Trail. Hike out the canyon to the east and you will reach a point that allows you to look down into the impressive Middle Fork. Middle Fork: The Middle Fork of Onion Creek is a short romp for hikers. At the Middle Fork/East Fork Junction turn north (left) and you can explore up the Middle Fork for a couple hundred yards until stopped be a nice 40-foot dryfall. It's worth exploring this fork as it carves deep into the cliffs. East Fork: The East Fork of Onion Creek might be the most interesting to hikers. At the Middle Fork/East Fork Junction continue straight ahead (right) and you can hike deep into the Mystery Towers region. Approximately 1/2 mile above the Middle/East Junction you will encounter a handline that allows you to scale a steep and slippery section of canyon. Many will consider this a good place to turn around. For those who want to see it all scramble up the handline and continue hiking up the creek bottom. Soon you will be stopped by a large boulder blocking the stream bottom. If you look to the west (left) you will see two prominent rock formations known as the \"Aliens\". For those who wish to explore further you can climb out of the canyon near the Aliens. Technical Route Option: For the technically skilled in the crowd Onion Creek offers an interesting route. The route has one 40-foot rappel from a bolted anchor and requires an 80-foot rope. The difficulty in this route is not the technical climbing skills required as those are minor. But your navigational and route finding skills had better be top notch or you will find yourself backtracking and doing a lot of up and down climbing. The technical route is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. The technical route consists of hiking up the East Fork of Onion Creek. Climbing out of the canyon to the west at the two prominent rock formations known as the \"Aliens\". Route finding your way to the base of the massive and beautiful rock tower that rock climbers call \"Gothic Nightmare\" (N38° 43' 04\", W109° 16' 59\"). From the base of Gothic Nightmare you must route find your way west and down into the bottom of the Middle Fork. Once you are in the bottom of Middle fork it's an easy stroll down to the dryfall and rappel that stops hikers coming up from the bottom. History: Huntley Ingalls, writing for National Geographic in 1962 after the first ascent of the tower known as \"the Titan\" referred to the Fisher Towers area as \"a pink, red, orange skyscraper city in nightmare Gothic\".

The routes name was meant as a comparison of the seven waterfalls in the canyon to these seven heavenly sisters of mythology. Pleiades is a water park paradise hidden in an indescribable canyon buried in an incredible landscape. The stream weaves its magical way through a slot of sculpted sandstone beckoning to be explored. The route begins the canyoneering season challenging the technical experts before relenting in mid summer to welcome the novice accompanied by competent leadership. General Information: Pleiades is a technical canyoneering route that requires complete technical gear. The route will require approximately 3 hours to complete. This route is located in a high mountain setting. The trailhead is located at an elevation of 9000-feet. The route has a season that begins approximately the first week of June and stretches through the end of October. After the first serious snow fall of the year the canyon will be buried under several feet of snow and ice. Expect to find snow and ice in the canyon through the month of May each year. Pleiades begins each year with a Canyon Rating of 3C II that will decrease to a 3B II rating by the end of summer. The canyon begins each year as an experts only route which decreases to a route suitable for beginners with competent leadership by summers end. You will have several chances to escape this route before committing completely to the most serious section of final rappels. If you do not feel comfortable with the water flow escape to play another day. Navigation for this route is moderate. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Mount Tukuhnikivatz\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a minor flash flood danger. In normal conditions this route will have water flow, wetsuits or drysuits are advised. Complete rain suits consisting of a jacket and pants can be used in place of a wetsuit in low stream flow conditions. The route will require wading to knee deep, but should not require any swimming. The tallest rappel in the canyon is 70-feet. Because of variable canyon conditions a 150- foot rope is recommended. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. The anchors in this canyon are plentiful and easy to locate. Trailhead Information: From the center of Moab head south out of town on U.S. Highway 191 for approximately 7 1/2 miles to mile marker 117.9 (N38° 29' 13\", W109° 27' 46\"). Turn east (left) on the signed Kens Lake Road. Follow the road east for 0.5 miles to a tee. Turn south (right) on the LaSal Mountain Loop Road. Follow the road south for 4.8 miles to a fork (N38° 26' 49\", W109° 23' 11\"), take the east (left) fork. Follow the road east for 6.7 miles to a second fork in the road (N38° http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/pleiades.htm 1/25/2018 Pleiades - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 29' 19\", W109° 18' 56\"). Take the south (right) fork signed Geyser Pass. The road turns to graded dirt at this fork. Follow the Geyser Pass Road 2.6 miles to the Pleiades Trailhead. The Pleiades Trailhead is easy to identify as it contains a BLM sign-in box and is signed \"Squaw Springs Trail\". There is parking at the trailhead for several vehicles. The road to the trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in normal weather while this canyon is in season. Note that the Geyser Pass Road is not shown correctly on the USGS maps. The road has been re-aligned since the USGS map was last updated in 1987. Route Information: From the Pleiades Trailhead (N38° 28' 46\", W109° 17' 22\"), follow the Squaw Springs Trail south for 1/3 mile to where a wire fence intersects the trail. Follow the fence west (right) for 250 yards to where the fence ends at Brumley Creek. This is where the actual technical slot canyon begins. Follow the drainage downstream to the first rappel, which is 20-feet and anchored from a large log. Continue downstream to the second rappel, which is anchored from a large pine tree on the south (left) side of the canyon. The second rappel is two-staged and the total length when both stages are chained together is 50-feet. This is immediately followed by the third rappel, which is 35-feet and anchored from a boulder. The bottom section of this rappel is free-hanging. This is immediately followed by the fourth rappel, which is 70-feet. The anchor for this rappel is a boulder located behind the waterfall you just descended. This is the section of canyon where you will get soaked as part of the rappel is right in the waterfall. This is immediately followed by the fifth rappel, which is 50-feet and anchored from two bolts on the north (right) canyon wall. From the bottom of the fifth rappel downclimb a final 15- foot waterfall. After the rapid-fire drops the canyon opens and the route ends (N38° 28' 31\", W109° 17' 33\"). Yes, it's a very short route. At the bottom of the final waterfall you will find a hiker/animal trail on the south (left) side of the canyon. You want to find this trail as it makes the hike out a lot easier. The hiker/animal trail is steep and climbs out of the canyon bottom to the south of the rock formation that formed the slot canyon. Follow the most well traveled hiker/animal trail and it will lead you back to the start of the route where you can intersect the Squaw Springs Trail and hike back to the trailhead. Ice Climbing: Pleiades becomes an entertaining ice climb in winter. You get to canyoneer down and climb back up, which is a lot of fun.

The canyon offer opportunities for both hikers and technical canyoneers. The area is off the radar of the normal Moab tourist so finding a little seclusion is not difficult. A beautiful stream flows through brilliant deep red canyon walls. This is a great adventure that all fit adults and older children should enjoy. General Information: Professor Creek is a technical canyoneering route that is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. The scenery is dramatic. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 6 to 8 hours. Professor Creek requires complete technical gear. Professor Creek is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is accessible year round, but the route would not be at it's best during cold weather. The highlight of the route is the ability to cool off in the clear, fresh water on a hot summer day. You will get soaking wet completing this route. The typical method of completing this canyon that yields favorable results is to choose a warm to hot summer day and get an early start so you can get the exposed hiking out of the way in the cooler morning temperatures. With this approach you should hit the waterpark section of the route just as the temperatures begin to rise and you are looking for a good place to cool off. In normal conditions this canyon requires a lot of wading, but no swimming. The deepest pool is usually waist deep. The route contains two rappels with the longest being 25-feet, but because of the variable options in rigging the final rappel a 100-foot rope is recommended. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. The anchors in this canyon are all easy to locate. Navigation for this route is moderate. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Fisher Towers\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. Trailhead Information: Drive north out of Moab on Highway 191 approximately 2 miles to the junction with Highway 128. Drive east on Highway 128, along the Colorado River, for 18 miles to the signed \"Ranch Road - Dead End\" turn-off located at mile marker 18.3 on the south (right) side of the highway. Follow the graded Ranch Road south for 2.1 miles until it ends at the Professor Creek Trailhead. The Professor Creek Trailhead is normally accessible to all vehicles in normal weather conditions. There are numerous BLM campsites located along the Colorado River and in nearby Onion Creek. Portable toilets are required for those camping along Onion Creek. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/professor.htm 1/25/2018 Professor Creek - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 Route Information: From the Professor Creek Trailhead (N38° 41' 01\", W109° 21' 20\") follow the well used hiker trail south along Professor Creek. It's hard to get lost as you just hike along and in Professor Creek. Approximately two miles into the hike the canyon walls begin to narrow up and things start to become more interesting. 3 1/2 miles into the hike you will encounter a fault line joint (N38° 39' 42\", W109° 19' 25\") that allows you to escape out the west (right) side of the canyon. There is a medium sized cottonwood tree near the fault line joint that will help you locate the escape. The escape itself not that difficult to identify if you are looking for it as it's one of the few place where you can reasonably escape to the canyon rim. If you reach the Professor Creek Waterfall you have gone approximately 1/4 mile to far. Climb up the fault line joint using care not to dislodge any loose rocks. Once you reach the rim you want to look south and aim for the high point (N38° 39' 10\", W109° 19' 22\") about 1/2 mile south. The high point is noted as 5105T on the USGS map. It's better to circle out and away from Professor Creek for the easiest hiking. Do not attempt to hike the rim near Professor Creek or you will be hating life as you encounter numerous side drainages feed Professor Creek. From the high point look southeast and you will see a rounded dome (5105T on the USGS map) about 3/4 mile away. Hike towards the rounded dome and just before you reach it you will encounter a gully. Hike down the gully to the start of Professor Creek (N38° 39' 07\", W109° 18' 32\"). You have now reached the beginning of the Professor Creek Waterpark®. Begin hiking downstream and let the fun begin. You will soon encounter a chokestone that requires a 10-foot rappel from a bolted anchor on top. This drop can also be downclimb, but keep in mind if you break your leg you are at least 8 hours away from mediocre medical care. As you continue downstream the canyon gets deeper with numerous pools, cascades and a couple of waterslides. There are several side canyons that are worth exploring, with the best being Hell Roaring Canyon (N38° 39' 18\", W109° 18' 55\") which enters form the east (right) approximately 1/2 mile after you enter the waterpark section. Approximately 3/4 miles below Hell Roaring Canyon you will encounter the final technical aspect of the route and the signature feature of the canyon, which is the Professor Creek Waterfall. The rappel is 25-feet high but the anchor for the rappel varies depending on recent conditions and who rebuilt it last. There is often a rock cairn built just above the waterfall or you can sling a large boulder that is located 25-feet upstream from the waterfall. Once at the base of the waterfall enjoy the view and hike 3 3/4 miles downstream and back to the trailhead. Hiking Option: For those wishing to hike the route and avoid the technical aspect just follow the stream up river until stopped by the waterfall. The route is approximately 3 3/4 miles each way and should take 4 to 5 hours round trip. Navigation is easy and it's almost impossible to get lost. The hiking route is rated 1A II using the Canyon Rating System.

We call it Repeat Jr. because this slot is similar to its neighbor Winter Camp Slot in feel and personality, but on a smaller scale. As technical routes go this is an easy slot canyon. The obstacles are all straightforward and easy to defeat. The scenery is terrific. The route is beginner friendly with competent leadership. General Information: Repeat Jr. is a technical canyoneering route that is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 2 hours. Repeat Jr. requires complete technical gear and is rated 3A I using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is accessible year round. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. This canyon should be dry in almost all weather conditions. No wading or swimming is required. The route contains one rappel of approximately 150-feet (I never measured this rappel). Two 200-foot ropes are more than enough, or you can use one 200-foot rope and retrieve it after you complete the route, which is what I recommend. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Navigation for this route is easy. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Cisco SW\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Hiker Notes: Hikers can explore a large portion of this slot canyon by reversing the route described. This route is an outstanding opportunity for hikers to visit a beautiful slot canyon. Trailhead Information: While this route is located just outside of Arches National Park it's a long drive to the trailhead because the route is located on the backside of Arches National Park. The road is normally suitable for high clearance vehicles and carefully driven passenger cars in dry weather conditions. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Green River, Utah: Travel east for 18 miles to Crescent Junction (where I-70 meets Highway 191). From Moab, Utah: Travel north on Highway 191 for 30 miles to Crescent Junction (where I-70 meets Highway 191). From Crescent Junction: Follow I-70 east for 11 miles to Exit 193 (N38° 56' 32\", W109° 36' 53\"), signed Yellow Cat. Exit I-70 and turn south. Follow the graded Yellow Cat Road southeast for 6.2 miles to a fork (N38° 52' 04\", W109° 33' 00\"). Take the east (left) fork. Continue following the road for 2.1 miles to the Yellow Cat Mine Ruins (N38° 50' 53\", W109° 31' 42\"). The ruins are located on the east side of the road. From The Yellow Cat Mine Ruins follow the road east for 1.0 mile to a fork (N38° 51' 01\", W109° 30' 38\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 2.6 miles to a fork (N38° 49' http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/repeatjr.htm 1/25/2018 Repeat Jr. - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 27\", W109° 29' 48\"). Take the east (left) fork and follow the road 3.1 miles to a junction (N38° 48' 31\", W109° 26' 53\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 1.5 miles to a junction (N38° 47' 49\", W109° 25' 47\"), with a rough 4x4 track heading east (left). Carefully driven passenger vehicles and high clearance vehicles can normally reach this junction without problems; beyond this point the road is a hardcore four wheel drive track. Most canyoneers will want to walk from this junction. Follow the hardcore four wheel drive track east for 0.2 miles to where you can pull off the road in a small wash; this is the Repeat Jr. Trailhead. Route Information: From the Repeat Jr. Trailhead (N38° 47' 51\", W109° 25' 34\"), hike north down a small wash for 1/4 mile until the bottom falls out of the wash and you encounter the only rappel on the route (N38° 48' 01\", W109° 25' 30\"). This rappel is approximately 150-feet from the canyon rim to the canyon floor. The rappel is anchored by a large tree. It is suggested that you leave your rope and retrieve it when you exit. You will walk right by the top of the slot on your hike out. The rappel is not a simple straightforward drop, instead it requires the canyoneer to downclimb the last half of the rappel. Once at the bottom of the rappel hike downstream and enjoy your surroundings. Most of the time you will be walking in a narrow slot canyon that is completely void of any obstacles. In fact, the compete lack of obstacles will be one of the points of interest to experienced canyoneers who are accustomed to fighting their way through similar slot canyons. The highlight of this route is just that it's a nice little slot canyon. From the base of the rappel hike downstream for approximately 1/3 mile to where the canyon begins to open up and it becomes easy to escape out the south (right) side of the slot (N38° 48' 15\", W109° 25' 19\"), this is your exit. Climb out of the canyon to the south (right) and hike 1/3 mile south to the top of the slot to retrieve your rope, and than continue 1/4 mile back to the trailhead.

Rarely visited Ring Arch might be the hike you are interested in. The route is easy to follow, requires only a couple of hours time, and follows a cheerful stream much of the way. General Information: Ring Arch is a wonderful desert hike that will require 2 to 3 hours round trip. The route is 1 3/4 miles each way along a stream and across flat desert. Elevation gain on this hike is virtually nil. This route should be easy for any experienced hiker. In normal conditions, with a little care and commonsense, you can complete this route with dry shoes. All others will find ankle to knee deep wading along the route. This route combines nicely with The Tunnel. Ring Arch requires you carry a least enough water for half-a-day in the desert, depending on current conditions. Beginners might find a 60-foot section of rope helpful as a handline if they wish to stand directly under the arch. Navigation for this route is moderate. There is no trail for most of the way but the route follows the bottom of two washes so it is not difficult to follow. Paying attention to your map and route description is required. Mistakes in navigation are easy to overcome and correct on this route. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"The Windows Section\" are helpful. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. This route is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Follow the route described and you will avoid areas of cryptobiotic crust along this route. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy decades of growth! Ring Arch Facts: Ring Arch is an old pothole type natural arch, formed of Entrada sandstone. It has a span of 64 feet, a height of 39 feet, a thickness of two feet, and a width of 2 1/2 feet. The arch was discovered on March 31, 1940, by Harry Reed, Moab photographer and former custodian of Arches national Monument. Slim Mabery, former district ranger at the monument, named it Ring Arch for its shape. Trailhead Information: From Arches National Park Visitor Center drive into the park for 4.4 miles to the bridge over Courthouse Wash. Park at the large, paved, pull-out on the north (left) side of the road, just east of the bridge. This is the Courthouse Wash Trailhead. The trailhead easily accommodates several vehicles. There is no restroom at the trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all conditions. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/ring.htm 1/25/2018 Ring Arch - Arches National Park - Hiking Page 2 of 2 Route Information: From the Courthouse Wash Trailhead (N38° 38' 58\", W109° 35' 54\"), follow the well-traveled use trail that leads directly west toward the massive sandstone buttress. The use trail is almost a direct path along the north side of Courthouse Wash. Once the trail reaches the massive sandstone buttress is drops down and follows along the stream in Courthouse Wash. The trail soon disappears, but just keep following the stream up river. 1 mile after leaving the trailhead you will notice a major drainage (N38° 39' 08\", W109° 36' 44\") entering from the north (right) that leads to The Tunnel. Continue hiking up Courthouse Wash an additional 1/4 mile to where a second massive sandstone buttress begins closing in from the north (right). Across from the Second Buttress on the south (left) side of the stream is a sizable tributary (N38° 39' 08\", W109° 37' 02\"). Follow the tributary south for 1/4 mile until it climbs out of the sand and onto slickrock (N38° 39' 00\", W109° 37' 09\"). From the top of the slickrock you should be able to easily see Ring Arch (N38° 39' 00\", W109° 37' 21\") 300 yards to the west. You might be tempted to cut cross-country on your return to the trailhead. This is a bad idea, you will encounter lots of sticker bushes and cryptobiotic crust, which makes route finding a major headache. Its much easier and faster to walk the wash bottoms and return the way you came. Arch Bagging: In 1982, Gerry Roach wrote a self published book titled \"Arch Bagger\". This was his first book and a mere 300 copies were printed. The book is long out of print, and it is very rare. Ring Arch was one of the 39 arches identified in Arch Bagger. After Roach published Arch Bagger, the National Park Service defined new rules for climbing in Arches National Park. Climbing is prohibited on any arch identified on current USGS 7.5 minute topographical maps. The historical route to the top of Ring Arch involved scrambling but no technical equipment.

The route involves just enough hiking to keep out the riff-raff, but not deter the average rock art enthusiast. This is a must-do route. General Information: The Owl Petroglyph Panel is an entertaining way to spend half-a-day in Moab away from the normal tourist routes. The actual panel contains a petroglyph of an owl, next to a very large anthropomorphic (human) figure, an awesome thunderbird, along with the usual big horn sheep and other figures. There are abundant petroglyphs along a 1/4 mile section of cliff that allows for plenty of exploring and discovery. A round trip to the Owl Petroglyph Panels requires approximately 3 to 4 hours, which includes time to enjoy and explore. The route requires some steep hiking but no major rock scrambling or other obstacles. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The Owl Petroglyph Panel is rated 1A II using the Canyon Rating System. Nearby camping is available at Moonflower Canyon 1/2 mile away. Trailhead Information: This short hike is located just outside of Moab. The trailhead is accessible year round to all vehicles. Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the corner of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 4.7 miles to where the pavement ends at a cattle guard (N38° 32' 03\", W109° 36' 00\"). From the cattle guard follow the well maintained dirt road south for 1.2 miles to the signed Amasa Back (Cliffhanger) Trailhead located on the north (right) side of the dirt road. The trailhead is easily identified by signs and a kiosk. Route Information: The first part of this hike follows the popular Amasa Back (Cliffhanger) four-wheel drive and mountain bike route. From the Amasa Back Trailhead (N38° 31' 27\", W109° 36' 06\"), follow the Amasa Back Road as it descends steeply to Kane Creek. Cross Kane Creek, and continue to follow the road as it climbs steeply away from the creek. After hiking 1/2 mile from the trailhead, the steeply climbing road will level out for a short distance (N38° 31' 34\", W109° 36' 15\"). At this point you will see a developing use trail heading north (right) from the road, which continues west. Follow the developing use trail heading north to where it climbs a steep gully littered with large boulders. The hike up the gully is not difficult, just follow the well defined use trail. As you near the top of the gully start to look around for petroglyphs, they are numerous for the remainder of the hike. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/owl.htm 1/25/2018 Owl Panel - Petroglyph - Moab Page 2 of 2 At the top of the gully you will find a large flat bench area with a spring hidden in the back alcove. Follow the use trail north (right) as it climbs up to the base of the soaring cliff and follows north along the cliff bottom to the Owl Petroglyph Panel (N38° 31' 38\", W109° 36' 09\"). Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

This route is a step back in time to a prehistoric age. The route is destined to become a Moab favorite. The route is beginner friendly with competent leadership. General Information: Rock of Ages is a technical canyoneering route that is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. The scenery is dramatic. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 5 hours. Rock of Ages requires complete technical gear. Rock of Ages is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is accessible year round, but the route would not be at it's best during the hot summer month's. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. Keep a careful watch as there are several sections of poison ivy along the route. Navigation for this route is moderate. The route does traverse through some areas of cryptobiotic soil but they are easy to avoid with a little care. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. In normal conditions this canyon might require some minor wading. The route contains one mandatory rappel that is exactly 100-feet from anchor to ground. One 60-meter rope is required, make certain your rope is not short or you will be in trouble. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. The anchors in this canyon are all easy to locate. Trailhead Information: Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the corner of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 4.6 miles, just before the pavement ends, you will see the private Kane Creek Campground on the south (left) side of the road. This is the trailhead. The campground is signed and marked by a split rail fence. Park outside the fence in the large dirt parking lot at the entrance to Kane Creek Campground. The road to the trailhead is paved and is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. This trailhead is also the start of the famous Pritchett Canyon Jeep Trail. You will be sharing the parking area and the first 1/2 mile of trail with the 4x4 and ATV crowd. The first 100-yards of the route crosses private property. You are asked to pay a small fee to cross the private property. The fee was $1.00 for hikers in 2012. Do not attempt to drive up the Pritchett Canyon Jeep Trail without a hardcore 4x4. You will encounter a major rock obstacle immediately after the campground. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38° 32' 06\", W109° 35' 59\"), start hiking up the Pritchett Canyon 4x4 Road as it passes through the campground. The road heads north briefly and then turns south as it follows the bottom of Pritchett Canyon. After hiking approximately 1/2 mile you will notice a deep narrow canyon entering from the east (left) side (N38° 32' 03\", W109° 35' 38\"). Turn east http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/rockofages.htm 1/25/2018 Rock of Ages - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 into the deep narrow canyon and begin hiking up the drainage. You will notice the beginnings of a use trail developing in the bottom of the canyon. You can follow the use trail where it is obvious all the way to Pool Arch. Watch for poison ivy as you leave the Pritchett Canyon Road and begin hiking up the drainage. Once you begin hiking up the deep narrow canyon its hard to get lost. Just keep hiking up, after about 1/3 mile the canyon will narrow up and you can scramble out the top of the canyon. You will soon discover you are still in a canyon, but the canyon will be wider here. Just keep hiking up the main drainage. After about 1/3 mile the canyon will narrow up and you can scramble out the top of the canyon... déjà vu! After you climb out the top of the canyon for the second time if you turn around and look back down the canyon you will have a good view of Chimney Arch on the south canyon wall. To keep things simple we will call this the Chimney Arch Viewpoint (N38° 32' 08\", W109° 34' 51\"). From the Chimney Arch Viewpoint just keep hiking east following the main drainage and the use trail. There are several minor obstacles but if you are paying attention you will notice the use trail avoids them. Approximately 1/3 mile after leaving the Chimney Arch Viewpoint the drainage you have been following will end and present you with a magnificent view looking down into a large valley. You will observe several small drainage's lead down to the bottom of the large valley. You can actually climb down just about anywhere in this area, but to visit the impressive Pool Arch you will want to climb down the small drainage furthest to the north (left) side. If you are at the top of the correct drainage you can see Pool Arch before starting your descent. Following this small drainage down will deposit you right at the base of Pool Arch (N38° 32' 09\", W109° 34' 21\"). If you want to rappel Pool Arch see the Pool Arch Stunt Rappel information below. If you are like most people you will be surprised at the size of Pool Arch. The opening is 90-feet high. This is a good place to take a break and enjoy a snack. Take the time to scramble up through the opening of Pool Arch and enjoy the interesting chamber hidden on the back side. After leaving Pool Arch just follow the main drainage downstream. The drainage will hook around to the south and enter a short section of slot canyon (N38° 32' 06\", W109° 34' 16\"). The slot canyon section is inspiring and contains several potholes that might require wading if it has been wet recently. Shortly the slot section ends at a 50-foot drop. You have two choices to get to the bottom of the 50-foot drop. The first choice is to rappel from two bolts that are 15-yards further along the north (right) rim. The second option is to scramble down a ledge system that begins just past the bolts. From the top it doesn't look like the ledge system goes all the way to the bottom, but as you begin downclimbing you will discover the route to the bottom is straight forward. Some canyoneers consider the ledge system to be an easy downclimb, while other have called it sketchy. It just depends on what your comfort zone is. From the bottom of the 50-foot drop just keep hiking downstream. Soon the canyon swings to the south and deposits you at the top of a 100-foot drop. Before you begin the rappel down take a minute and notice the use trail as it leaves the grotto below and makes it's way down to the Pritchett Canyon 4x4 Road. The use trail climbs out of the grotto on the east (left) side and follows the minor ridge down to the road. Following the use trail makes things much easier. The 100-foot rappel is currently anchored by two bolts on the face of the cliff, this \"lean- too\" anchor kind of sucks as you must downclimb to the ledge at the head of the canyon and than lean out over the abyss to attach your ropes and to hook up your rappel. There is an easy to find bolt located next to a shrubby bush at the head of the pour-off that allows you to protect the lean- too when dealing with these bolts. The bottom half of the final rappel is free hanging and the rappel deposits you in a lush grotto. Depart the grotto following the use trail you spied from above. Just as the use trail reaches it's highest point if you look to your north (right) side you will notice some Anasazi ruins tucked back under an overhang in the lower cliff. After viewing the ruins just hike down and intersect http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/rockofages.htm 1/25/2018 Rock of Ages - Moab - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 the Pritchett Canyon 4x4 Road (N38° 31' 51\", W109° 34' 54\"). Once on the road just follow it downstream for 1 1/4 miles and you will end up back at the trailhead. Pool Arch Stunt Rappel: Rappelling into the chamber behind Pool Arch and climbing down through the arch is popular. I refer to this as a \"stunt rappel\" because it is not a requirement for completing this route and is normally done as a way of upping the thrill (and danger) factor. The stunt rappel also requires that you carry twice the rope. The actual height of the rappel is approximately 170-feet, and requires two 60-meter ropes. The rappel is anchored from a pinion tree centered at the top of the cliff north of Pool Arch. To reach the rappel anchor you must backtrack a couple hundred yards from the point where you can first see Pool Arch. Circle around the large sandstone dome to the north and you will walk right out to the rappel anchor and a beautiful view of Pool Arch from the backside. Pool Arch Statistics: Greater Arch Dimension (GAD): 90 feet. For this arch, the GAD is its height. Lesser Arch Dimension (LAD): 80 feet. For this arch, the LAD is its span. Arch Type: Fin Rock formation and/or type: Navajo Sandstone Chimney Arch Statistics: Greater Arch Dimension (GAD): 40 feet. For this arch, the GAD is its span. Lesser Arch Dimension (LAD): 3 feet. For this arch, the LAD is its height. Arch Type: Propped Rock formation and/or type: Navajo Sandstone. Pritchett Canyon History: The canyon is named after Thomas Pritchett who enter the Spanish Valley in 1880 and was the first justice of the peace. He lived with a group of people in a fort in Pritchett Canyon during the winter of 1880-81. Video: Enjoy a short video from Rock of Ages in Moab, Utah.

Petroglyphs Moab Hiking & Rock Art A nice stroll in the desert takes you to the Kokopelli Petroglyph Panel, the Centipede (Fish Man) Pictograph Panel, The Lonesome Shaman Pictograph and the Guardian Pictograph. That's a lot of rock art bang for the small price of admission. General Information: Sevenmile Canyon is a 4 1/2 mile round trip hike that visits four interesting and unique rock art panels. A round trip to visit all four panels requires about 3 hours. The route contain almost zero elevation change and no scrambling, but you will be hiking in sand almost the entire route. This is an outstanding cool and cold weather hike. The route would be miserable during the mid-day summer sun. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. Binoculars are useful in locating and viewing the rock art. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route and locating specific panels of rock art. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Merrimac Butte\" shows the area described. There is no trail for this route, but navigation for this route is easy. The entire route follows a dry streambed so it's almost impossible to get lost. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Sevenmile Canyon is rated 1A II using the Canyon Rating System. A tour involving Intestine Man, Snake in Mouth and the rock art panels in Sevenmile Canyon are usually combined into an impressive adventure requiring about half-a-day. Trailhead Information: This hike is located just outside of Moab on the road to Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands Island in the Sky District. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles, year round, via a paved highway. From Moab head north out of town on U.S. Highway 191. Cross the bridge over the Colorado River. After crossing the bridge continue north for 8.3 miles to the junction with State Road 313, signed Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands. Turn west (left) on State Road 313 and follow it for 2.5 miles to mile marker 20, the trailhead is the actual mile marker. You can park just north of the mile marker in a small pull-out that will accommodate a couple of vehicles. As an alternate, you can also park 0.3 miles east at mile marker 22.3 where a 4-wheel drive track enters Sevenmile Canyon. Those with serious 4-wheel drives can actually drive up the sandy bottom of Sevenmile Canyon. The route gets more rugged the further you drive and is entirely in deep sand. Route Information: From the trailhead at mile marker 20 (N38° 38' 57\", W109° 43' 20\"), drop down to the sandy floor of Sevenmile Canyon and begin hiking upstream (southwest). You will be hiking in the bottom of this big sandy wash for the entire route. 3/4 miles after leaving the trailhead you will notice a prominent nose jutting from the south canyon wall. The Kokopelli Petroglyph Panel (N38° 38' 24\", W109° 43' 43\") is located on the downstream side of the nose about 30-feet http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sevenmile.htm 1/25/2018 Sevenmile Canyon - Moab - Rock Art Page 2 of 2 above a shady alcove. The panel is covered with dozens of figures, many of which are Kokopelli. To reach the actual panel you must follow a faint hiker trail up the front of the nose to the base of the cliff. Once you reach the base of the cliff just follow the ledge system around to the downstream (east) side of the nose. From the Kokopelli Panel continue hiking upstream 3/4 miles to a large alcove at streambed level on the south (left) side of the canyon. This is referred to as the Centipede Alcove (N38° 38' 01\", W109° 44' 10\") and contains several interesting pictographs. The most prominent figure is located in a hueco (solution pocket) and consists of a small anthropomorphic (human) figure with a centipede next to it. This panel is also referred to as \"Fish Man\", because some believe it looks like a fisherman and his catch of the day. If you stick you head just below the hueco and turn around you will be surprised to find a couple really nice big horn sheep pictographs on the ceiling. Exploring the alcove will reveal more rock art. From the Centipede Alcove continue hiking upstream 1/2 mile to the Lonesome Shaman Pictograph (N38° 37' 50\", W109° 44' 36\"). This is a lone figure located on the face of the cliff. The pictograph is easily visible and located on a ledge about 20-feet above the streambed. From the Lonesome Shaman continue hiking upstream 200-yards to the Guardian Pictograph (N38° 37' 47\", W109° 44' 34\"). This is a lone figure located on the face of the cliff. The pictograph is somewhat faded, but is still easily visible and located on a ledge about 20-feet above the streambed. Return the way you came. Kokopelli: Kokopelli is a fertility deity, usually depicted as a humpbacked flute player, often with a huge phallus and antenna-like protrusions on his head. Kokopelli has been venerated by some Native American cultures in the Southwestern United States. Like most fertility deities, Kokopelli presides over both childbirth and agriculture. He is also a trickster god and represents the spirit of music. Video: Enjoy a short video from Sevenmile Canyon in Moab, Utah. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

While most the canyons in the area are great fun for the family and the less skilled canyoneer, this canyon exacts a high price for admission. The beauty and scenery are dazzling, but you need to bring some serious skills to experience it Photography compliments of Blake Merrell. Warning: SGR is rated 3A R III using the Canyon Rating System. Every member of your group must be a skilled canyoneer. This canyon could be deadly for beginners, even with advanced leadership. The following description is not a substitute for experience and commonsense. To safely descend this canyon every member of your group must be comfortable high stemming 70- feet off the deck for short distances. Do not underestimate the difficulty of descending this canyon. You have been warned! Now that I've given you the big scary warning here are a few more details. While this canyon is certainly the most difficult canyon I know of in the Moab area, it's doesn't rate extremely high on the difficulty scale of advanced slot canyons on the Colorado Plateau. The section of required high stemming is approximately 100-feet long. The silos you must cross are not enormously wide and only about 5-feet long so they are not extremely difficult to cross, but a fall would have devastating consequences. Outside the short section of high stemming the canyon is relatively straightforward as technical canyons go. General Information: SGR is a serious canyoneering route that requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 8 to 9 hours. The canyon is accessible year round, but the route would be brutally hot in the summer month's, spring and fall are the preferred seasons. This route can be completed in winter provided there is no snow on the ground and that you get an early start to avoid running out of daylight. Navigation for this route requires advanced skills as you must navigate through sandstone domes and cross joints carefully choosing the path of least resistance, errors in navigation can be time consuming. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Kane Springs\" and \"Trough Springs Canyon\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. The route does traverse through areas of cryptobiotic soil but they can be avoided with a little care. In normal conditions this canyon might require some minor ankle to waist deep wading. The route contains several rappels with the longest mandatory rappel being 85-feet. The route does contain an optional 100-foot rappel. One 60-meter (200-foot) rope is required, if doing the optional rappel make certain your rope is not short or you will be in trouble. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 75-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sgr.htm 1/25/2018 SGR Slot - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Trailhead Information: A four-wheel-drive is required for accessing this trailhead. The area described is criss- crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Just reaching the trailhead can be a journey. From Center and Main in Moab drive south out of town on U.S. Highway 191 for 13.0 miles to mile marker 112.7 (N38° 25' 16\", W109° 25' 58\"). To the unsigned BLM 173/Pole Canyon Road located on the west (right) side of U.S. Highway 191. Follow BLM 173/Pole Canyon Road west for 0.4 miles to a fork in the road (N38° 25' 30\", W109° 26' 00\"). Take the west (left) fork and drive 4.8 miles to a fork in the road (N38° 25' 56\", W109° 30' 08\"). Take the north (right) fork and drive 100-yards to a junction (N38° 26' 01\", W109° 30' 09\"). Turn northeast (right) and drive 0.9 miles to a 4-way junction (N38° 26' 26\", W109° 29' 23\"). Turn north (left) and drive 0.9 miles to a tee junction (N38° 27' 10\", W109° 29'239\"). Turn west (left) and drive 0.3 miles to a 4-way junction (N38° 27' 09\", W109° 29' 45\"), Turn north (right) and drive 0.9 miles to the SGR Trailhead. The last section of road is very rough and some might prefer to walk it. Route Information: From the SGR Trailhead (N38° 27' 51\", W109° 29' 56\"), hike 200-yards north to a weakness in the rim of Hunter Canyon (N38° 27' 57\", W109° 29' 55\"). At this point you will have a good view of what is in store for you. Hike down through the weakness and scramble down the cliff bands to the bottom of Hunter Canyon. Once you reach the bottom of Hunter Canyon hike downstream 1/2 mile to where a large side canyon (N38° 28' 20\", W109° 30' 14\") enters from the north (right). Hike up the side canyon 1/2 mile, bypassing a short dryfall on the north (left) side, to a junction (N38° 28' 33\", W109° 29' 52\"), take the northwest (left) fork and continue hiking 3/4 miles up canyon. You will encounter three large dryfalls in this section of canyon. The first two dryfalls are bypassed by scrambling around the east (right) side and the third is bypassed by scrambling around the west (left) side. The canyon will end at the base of a large headwall. At the base of the headwall you will find a small joint on the northwest (left) side. Scramble up the side joint to where it tops out (N38° 29' 07\", W109° 29' 52\"). Once you reach the top of the small joint hike 1/3 mile northwest following a large wide side wash to its top (N38° 29' 23\", W109° 30' 03\"). At the top of the side wash is where the navigation really begins. At the top of the side wash look northeast 100-yards and you will see a passage (N38° 29' 25\", W109° 30' 01\") through the sandstone. Hike through the first passage. Your objective is to hike near the summit of highpoint 6530' located to your northeast, but hiking through the sandstone domes is complicated. The easiest route is to head for a 2nd passage (N38° 29' 34, W109° 29' 53\"), which is 1/4 mile away from the first. Once at the second passage continue hiking northeast for 200-yards to the rim of a small canyon (N38° 29' 39\", W109° 29' 48\"). At the rim of the small canyon hike 300-yards east to the top of the white cliffs (N38° 29' 39\", W109° 29' 39\"). At this point it is worth the short scramble to the summit of 6530', which offers amazing views of the Spanish Valley and the Moab area. From the top of the white cliffs make you way south 250-yards to the start of the technical section of SGR Slot (N38° 29' 33\", W109° 29' 34\") and the first rappel. You will find yourself descending a cross joint that descends to the southeast. The first rappel is 70-feet and anchored by a tree. Just downstream of the first rappel is the second rappel, which is 80-feet and anchored from a chokestone. The second rappel deposits you in a narrow section of slot. Just continue downstream and the canyon widens and than becomes really serious as it slots up again. When the canyon slots back up you will encounter an 75-foot drop into a silo, do not rappel into the silo, instead you must stem over the top of the silo and down canyon for 40-yards http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sgr.htm 1/25/2018 SGR Slot - Moab - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 to a second silo. The stemming is 60-feet up from the canyon bottom, as you near the second silo you will discover a small ledge on the east (left) side of the canyon that makes things easier. The third rappel is 80-feet and is anchored from a hueco (small solution pocket) or small tree. If using the small tree as the anchor rigging it with a sling can be difficult and has some exposure. If anchoring from the hueco you stand an excellent chance of sticking your ropes on the chokestone below when you retrieve your ropes, you have been warned. Some have found they can belay from the hueco anchor, which allows them to establish the tree anchor with some protection. Bottom-line is consideration should be given to how you intend to pull your ropes to avoid sticking them at this rappel. The third rappel deposits you into the most spectacular section of canyon. From the third rappel just continue downstream hiking and downclimbing through the best section of slot canyon, enjoy your time in this section of canyon as it ends all to soon. Once the slot section ends and the canyon opens up just continue downstream defeating minor obstacles as they present themselves. Soon you will encounter the fourth rappel, which is 25 feet and anchored from a bush. This is soon followed by the fifth rappel, which is 40-feet and anchored from a tree. Next up are more minor obstacles to play with before the sixth rappel, which is 75-feet and anchored from a tree. The sixth rappel deposits you in a section of narrows, continue through the narrows to a short downclimb into a small pool of water that will be knee to waist deep in normal conditions. This is the end of the slot section. Continue hiking downstream a short distance you will be standing on top of the headwall you climbed earlier in the day. You can descend the headwall using the small joint you climbed earlier in the day, or you can rappel the headwall. The rappel is 100-feet and anchored from a tree. From the base of the headwall return the way you came. Video: Enjoy a short video from SGR Slot in Moab, Utah compliments of Blake Merrell.

The petroglyphs are easy to visit and fun for the entire family. The petroglyphs have a mixture of human, animal, anthromorphs, patterns and abstract forms. This is one of the finest panels of rock art to be found, anywhere. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Shay Canyon Petroglyph Panel contains an amazing selection of easy to access petroglyphs. The petroglyphs are located along the relatively well-traveled access road into the Needles district of Canyonlands National Park. This is one of the most outstanding petroglyph panels you will ever visit. A round trip to Shay Canyon Petroglyphs requires approximately one hour. The actual hike is only a couple minutes each way, but you will want to spend more time scrambling along the base of the cliff searching out the numerous panels of rock art. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. A GPS is extreme overkill for this adventure, but I have provided the GPS waypoints for those that like playing with their toys. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Harts Point South\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. Shay Canyon Petroglyphs are rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. A trip to Shay Canyon Petroglyphs should also include a quick stop at Newspaper Rock. Trailhead Information: This short hike is located just outside of Canyonlands Needles District. The route is accessible to all vehicles, year round, via a paved highway. From Moab, Utah: Travel south on Highway 191 for 40 miles to the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211. The junction is signed Canyonlands. From Monticello, Utah: Travel north on Highway 191 for 15 miles to the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211. The junction is signed Canyonlands. From The Junction: At the junction of Highway 191 and Highway 211 (N38° 04' 27\", W109° 21' 00\"), follow Highway 211 west for 14 miles to mile marker 4.8 and a small parking area on the south (left) side of the road. This is the Shay Canyon Trailhead. The small parking area has room for three or four vehicles and is identified by a large flat-topped boulder next to the parking area and highway. For those familiar with the area all you really need to know is the trailhead is 1.9 miles west of Newspaper Rock on Highway 211. Route Information: From the Shay Canyon Trailhead (N38° 00' 35\", W109° 32' 16\") walk to the west side of the large flat-topped boulder and locate a hiker trail the heads south and crosses Indian Creek. Normally Indian Creek is not a problem to cross but it could present problems during adverse http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/shay.htm 1/25/2018 Shay Canyon Petrogylphs - Canyonlands National Park Page 2 of 2 weather conditions. Once you have crossed the creek you will locate a hiker trail heading south along the west bank of the wash exiting Shay Canyon. Just follow the hiker trail south for 250- yards to the base of the cliff guarding the west (right) side of the entrance to Shay Canyon. The Shay Canyon Petroglyphs (N38° 00' 32\", W109° 32' 24\") are located all along the base of the cliff. The more you search along the base of the cliff the more petroglyphs you will find. Additional Rock Art: Newspaper Rock, Shay Canyon Petroglyphs, Hog Canyon Petroglyphs and Fighting Men Petroglyphs are normally combined to create a delightful half-day adventure visiting native American rock art.

Best of all the short hike to the main attraction contains dozens of other petroglyphs and some minor Anasazi ruins. General Information: The Big Horn Sheep Petroglyph Panel is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours near Moab away from the normal tourist routes. The route contains numerous petroglyphs ending at the main attraction, which is a magnificent rock art panel containing about two dozen big horn sheep. Binoculars will be useful for detailed examination of the Big Horn Sheep Petroglyph Panel. Photographers will probably want to pack a zoom lens for their camera. A round trip to the Big Horn Sheep Petroglyph Panel requires approximately 1 hour, which includes time to enjoy and explore. A round trip is less than 1/2 mile of hiking. The route contains no major rock scrambling or other obstacles, but does require some short, but steep hiking. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least one liter of water. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The Big Horn Sheep Petroglyph Panel is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Nearby camping is available at Moonflower Canyon 1/2 mile away. Trailhead Information: This short hike is located just outside of Moab. The trailhead is accessible year round to all vehicles. Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the corner of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 4.7 miles to where the pavement ends at a cattle guard (N38° 32' 03\", W109° 36' 00\"). From the cattle guard follow the well maintained dirt road south for 0.7 miles to a large parking area located on the west (right) side of the dirt road. This is the Big Horn Sheep Petroglyph Trailhead. The trailhead is easily to identify as it is very large with parking for approximately 2 dozen vehicles. Route Information: From the Big Horn Sheep Petroglyph Trailhead (N38° 31' 42\", W109° 35' 48\"), walk to the east side of the dirt road and identify two trails. The first, and most prominent trail, leads east into the canyon. This is not the correct trail. You want to locate the less defined trail that switchbacks and climbs steeply to the base of the cliff just east of the parking area. This is the Big Horn Sheep Petroglyphs Trail. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sheep.htm 1/25/2018 Big Horn Sheep Panel - Petroglyph - Moab Page 2 of 2 From the trailhead follow the trail 150-yards as it climbs steeply to the base of the cliff (N38° 31' 38\", W109° 35' 44\"). At the base of the cliff you will find dozens of petroglyphs and some minor Anasazi ruins Follow the base of the cliff east locating more petroglyphs along the route. Soon you will come to a jumble of boulders you must make your way through. If your route finding skills are sharp you will locate a faint use trail through the boulder field that avoids most of the minor obstacles. Once through the boulder field you will be standing in the bottom of a drainage heading east. Climb up the drainage to where a small amount for easy scrambling might be required. At the top of the scramble look north and you will see the Big Horn Sheep Petroglyph Panel (N38° 31' 38\", W109° 35' 34\"). The panel is not right at the base of the cliff as you might expect, but is located about 20-feet high on the cliff. It is less then 1/4 mile from the trailhead to the Big Horn Sheep Petroglyph Panel. You can return the way you came or follow the use trail that leads to the bottom of the drainage and back to the trailhead. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

The panel requires a small amount of scrambling with minor exposure to visit. General Information: Snake in Mouth Pictograph Panel is an interesting way to spend your time exploring the area. The panel contains two large anthropomorphic (human) figures, with a large snake over the head of the first, and a small blue snake in the mouth of the second. It appears as if there was an interesting third figure present at one time but it has been naturally white washed over by time and the elements. A round trip to the pictograph panel requires approximately one hour. The route requires some minor scrambling over sandstone rocks. Binoculars might be useful in locating the pictograph panel and in scouting a route through the cliff bands to reach them. The rock art is accessible year round in all weather conditions. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Merrimac Butte\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Snake in Mouth is rated 2A I using the Canyon Rating System. A tour involving Intestine Man, Snake in Mouth and the rock art panels in Sevenmile Canyon are usually combined into an impressive adventure requiring about half-a-day. Trailhead Information: This short hike is located just outside of Moab on the road to Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands Island in the Sky District. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles, year round, via a paved highway. From Moab head north out of town on U.S. Highway 191. Cross the bridge over the Colorado River. After crossing the bridge continue north for 8.3 miles to the junction with State Road 313, signed Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands. Turn west (left) on State Road 313 and follow it for 2.5 miles to mile marker 20, the trailhead is the actual mile marker. You can park just north of the mile marker in a small pull-out that will accommodate a couple of vehicles. As an alternate, you can also park 0.3 miles east at mile marker 22.3 where a 4-wheel drive track enters Sevenmile Canyon. Those with serious 4-wheel drives can actually drive up the sandy bottom of Sevenmile Canyon. But the route contains sections of deep sand and driving up the wash will save you no time on this adventure. Route Information: From the trailhead at mile marker 20 (N38° 38' 57\", W109° 43' 20\"), you can actually see the pictographs in the alcove high above the canyon floor with a pair of binoculars. Before leaving the trailhead is a good time to check out the route you will want to scramble up to reach the pictograph panel. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/snakemouth.htm 1/25/2018 Snake in Mouth - Pictographs - Moab Page 2 of 2 From the trailhead hike south, cross the sandy bottom of Sevenmile Canyon, and make your way up through the layered sandstone levels. Some minor scrambling is required, but nothing serious if you use good route finding skills. When you reach the wide flat level that contains the pictograph panel, you will find a faint hiker trail that travels along the level to the Snake in Mouth Pictograph Panel (N38° 38' 53\", W109° 43' 09\"). If you explore around the area of the pictograph panel you should find at least one boulder that has some very faint petroglyphs on it. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

This route takes you on a trip back through time to a prehistoric age. General Information: Visiting the Solstice Snake requires a nice long hike to a remote location in an area known as \"Behind the Rocks\". A trip to the Solstice Snake requires about 6 hours round trip and that includes time to photograph and explore. The route is 4 miles each way and has 1200-feet of elevation gain. The route contains dramatic scenery and visits two interesting arches. The Solstice Snake is rated 1A III using the Canyon Rating System. The rock art is accessible year round, but the route would be miserable during the hot summer month's. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least two liters of water. The Solstice Snake gets its name from the \"dagger\" (arrowhead) shape that crosses the petroglyph, which is formed by sunlight filtering through the cliff high above on the day of the summer solstice. I have never personally witnessed this event. For anyone wanting to photograph the \"dagger\" through the Solstice Snake I'm told the event occurs at approximately 11:10 a.m. and lasts for about 2 minutes. I'm also told the event occurs for several days, both before and after the summer solstice for those that might be interested. Navigation for this route is moderate. The route does traverse through some areas of cryptobiotic soil but they are easy to avoid with a little care. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the corner of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 4.6 miles, just before the pavement ends, you will see the private Kane Creek Campground on the south (left) side of the road. This is the Pritchett Canyon Trailhead. The campground is signed and marked by a split rail fence. Park outside the fence in the large dirt parking lot at the entrance to Kane Creek Campground. The road to the trailhead is paved and is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. This trailhead is also the start of the famous Pritchett Canyon Jeep Trail. You will be sharing the parking area and the first 2 1/4 miles of trail with the 4x4 and ATV crowd. The first 100-yards of the route crosses private property. You are asked to pay a small fee to cross the private property. The fee was $1.00 for hikers in 2012. Do not attempt to drive up the Pritchett Canyon Jeep Trail without a hardcore 4x4. You will encounter a major rock obstacle immediately after the campground. Route Information: From the Pritchett Canyon Trailhead (N38° 32' 06\", W109° 35' 59\"), start hiking up the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/solsticesnake.htm 1/25/2018 Solstice Snake - Moab - Petroglyphs Page 2 of 2 Pritchett Canyon 4x4 Road as it passes through the campground. The road heads north briefly and then turns southeast as it follows the bottom of Pritchett Canyon. After hiking 2 1/4 miles the road will fork (N38° 31' 25\", W109° 34' 04\"). The fork to the south (right) is the Pritchett Canyon 4x4 Road. The fork to the east (left) is closed to vehicle travel and marked with a BLM Wildness Study marker. Follow the closed road to the east (left). 1/3 mile beyond the fork you will notice a unique natural bridge known as the \"Troll Bridge\" (N38° 31' 24\", W109° 33' 44\") located in the bottom of the canyon. 150-yards beyond the Troll Bridge you will reach a second fork in the road (N38° 31' 28\", W109° 33' 40\"). Take the fork to the east (left). Approximately 200-yards past the second fork look high on the canyon wall to the south (right) and you will see Dead End Arch (N38° 31' 27\", W109° 33' 31\"). The closed 4x4 road you are following will soon turn into a trail, eventually the trail will vanish and you will be hiking up the bottom of a canyon, which turns into a wash at the top. You will have to work your way around a couple of dryfalls in the canyon bottom, there is an easy way around both of the dryfalls if you pay attention. From the second junction it's 1 1/4 miles to the Solstice Snake Petroglyph. It's almost impossible to get lost as the wash you eventually end up following will lead you nearly all the way to the obvious buttress, which contains the Solstice Snake (N38° 31' 33\", W109° 32' 33\"). The Solstice Snake is located on the south side of the buttress. From the Solstice Snake hike 200-yards north to the toe of the next buttress north and you will find the Warrior Panel (N38° 31' 36\", W109° 32' 35\"). On the flat area in front of the Warrior Panel you will find a Kiva , which is in very poor condition. You will recognize the Kiva by the rocks placed in a circular pattern. Next to the Kiva is a hearth that is in excellent condition. Please don't touch or disturb these items. Take only pictures and leave only footprints. Cryptobiotic Soil: Follow the route described and you will avoid areas of cryptobiotic crust. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires years of undisturbed growth before it becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth. Troll Bridge Statistics: Greater Arch Dimension (GAD): 15 feet. For this arch, the GAD is its span. Lesser Arch Dimension (LAD): 15 feet. For this arch, the LAD is its height. Arch Type: Meander Bridge Rock formation and/or type: Chinle Sandstone Dead End Arch Statistics: Greater Arch Dimension (GAD): 20 feet. For this arch, the GAD is its height. Lesser Arch Dimension (LAD): 10 feet. For this arch, the LAD is its width. Arch Type: Fin Rock formation and/or type: Navajo Sandstone Pritchett Canyon History: The canyon is named after Thomas Pritchett who entered the Spanish Valley in 1880 and was the first justice of the peace.

The route traverses some of the most spectacular redrock terrain in the area. As with most of the Moab area canyons the route is best described as a captivating excursion. General Information: Tierdrop is best described as a short but fun technical route. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 hours. Tierdrop requires complete technical gear. The scenery is dramatic. Tierdrop is rated 3A I using the Canyon Rating System. You will need an Arches Canyoneering Permit to enter Tierdrop Canyon. In normal conditions the route should be dry. There are several rappels in the canyon with the highest being 100-feet. But because of the long rope pulls required to reach useable natural anchors two 60-meter ropes and a minimum of 100-feet of webbing are required, the innovative will probably be able to get by with less. The rappels are easy to rig using a large amount of rope and webbing, but are more difficult to rig using little or no webbing. This is a good place to practice your \"ghosting\" techniques. Ghosting is a canyoneering term that means leave no trace of your passing. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"The Windows Section\" and \"Moab\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Tierdrop use the WGS84 datum. This route has an extremely minor flash flood danger. This canyon is accessible year round, unless snow is on the ground. The route would be miserable during the hot part of the summer day. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. It is of value to note that Tierdrop, Not Tierdrop and U-Turn all use the same trailhead. This makes completing a combo platter of any combination of the canyons easy to complete in a single day. Trailhead Information: From Arches National Park Visitor Center drive into the park for 2.1 miles to the signed Park Avenue Trailhead and Viewpoint. Park in the large, paved, parking lot on the north (left) side of the road. The trailhead easily accommodates a large number of vehicles. There is no restroom at the trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: From the Park Avenue Trailhead and Viewpoint (N38° 37' 27\", W109° 36' 00\") walk west on the main road for about 75-yards to a combination small wash and use trail on the north side of the road. Follow the use trail west to the back corner of the massive cliffs. Hidden in the corner you will find the crack approach (N38° 37' 24\", W109° 36' 17\"). Scramble up the crack to the small saddle (N38° 37' 26\", W109° 36' 20\"). From the saddle it's just a short stroll north across slickrock to the top of Tierdrop Canyon (N38° 37' 32\", W109° 36' 22\"). The correct canyon is easy to identify by a short fat toadstool rock formation about 70-feet from the first drop and the obvious rope burns in the sandstone. If you are not seeing several dozen small rope burns where the canyon \"rolls over\" you are not in the correct drainage. The first rappel is 30-feet. In the past the toadstool was the standard anchor but rope pull was causing damage. A better anchor is a large rock on the east (right) side, that is 50 feet above you. I have also seen this first rappel downclimbed by the skilled wearing sticky rubber. A little road rash are the penalty points for screwing up the downclimb. This short rappel and scramble deposits you on the second tier. This is a wide area with several options to sling for a reliable rappel anchor. The rappel is 80-feet, but more rope might be required because of long rope pulls. The second rappel deposits you on the impressive third tier with several immense photogenic boulders. The third and final rappel is 100-feet and has several options in the form of different boulders you can sling to create a rappel anchor. After reaching the bottom of the third rappel you must follow the catwalk ledge north and then east to a simple downclimb. From the bottom of the simple downclimb just hike east a short distance until you intersect the Park Avenue hikers trail (N38° 37' 43\", W109° 36' 05\"). At the hiker trail turn south (right) and follow it back to the Park Avenue Trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/tierdrop.htm 1/25/2018 Tierdrop - Arches National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 Cryptobiotic Soil: Follow the route described and you will avoid areas of cryptobiotic crust. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth. Video: Enjoy a short video from Tierdrop Canyon. Video courtesy of Bob \"Slot Machine\" Allan.

The natural tunnel allows you to walk through the center of a massive sandstone buttress and easily transit between two valleys. This curiosity of nature can comfortably be visited by all family members. General Information: Tusher Tunnel is an easy adventure the entire family can enjoy. The route requires only a couple of hours, including driving time. The route is only 300 yards long with virtually no elevation gain. This route should be easy for most able bodied family members. The route involves some simple four wheel driving or a little extra hiking. The family SUV will have no problems. Navigation for this route is easy. GPS waypoints are provided for convenience. There is nothing difficult about the hike. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Jug Rock\" and \"Merrimac Butte\" show the area. The roads and tunnel are not shown on the USGS maps. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. The route is rated class 1 I using the Yosemite Decimal System. Trailhead Information: From the bridge over the Colorado River, just outside Moab, drive north on Highway 191 for approximately 13 miles. 100 yards north of mile marker 141 is a dirt road on the west (left) side of the highway signed \"Mill Canyon\" (N38° 43' 37\", W109° 43' 19\"). A high clearance vehicle is required for accessing the trailhead. The area is criss-crossed with roads and tracks. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Follow the Mill Canyon dirt road, across the railroad tracks for 0.6 miles to a fork in the road (N38° 43' 31\", W109° 43' 57\"). Take the north (right) fork signed \"Tusher Canyon\". Follow the Tusher Canyon Road for 1.9 miles to where the road drops down into a wash. If the wash is dry turn left, and follow the wash around the corner to an intersection (N38° 43' 10\", W109° 45' 45\"). The south (left) fork is signed \"Jeep Trail\", take the north (right) fork and follow the dirt road 0.9 miles to anther intersection (N38° 43' 40\", W109° 46' 30\"). Turn west (left) and follow the road 0.2 miles to where a lesser road forks (N38° 43' 32\", W109° 46' 39\") of to the south (left) . Follow the lesser road south (left) for 0.9 miles as it gradually climbs. You have now reached a point (N38° 42' 52\", W109° 46' 52\"), where the road continues straight ahead (west) up a steep hill, with a rough road branching to the south (left) that descends steeply into a canyon. This is as far as most high clearance two wheel drive vehicles can travel, if you are in a two wheel drive find a place to park and hike from here. All four wheel drive vehicles should be able to reach the actual trailhead with little problem. From the base of the small hill descend the four wheel drive track south for 100 yards as it steeply descends to the canyon bottom (N38° 42' 48\", W109° 46' 52\"). At the canyon bottom the road tee's, take the west (right) road and follow it for 0.2 miles to a small turn around. This is the trailhead (N38° 42' 40\", W109° 46' 58\"). It is marked with a small BLM sign noting \"trail\". There is an abundance's of primitive camping near the trailhead. This area is very popular with ATV's and the 4x4 crowd so do not expect solitude. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/tusher.htm 1/25/2018 Tusher Tunnel - Moab - Family Fun Page 2 of 2 Route Information: The driving directions are the real trick to finding Tusher Tunnel. Once you find the trailhead it is pretty simple. From the trailhead hike 100 yards west, up the hill, following the trail and brown BLM markers. The North Portal of Tusher Tunnel looks like the opening to a cave. Enter the portal and start walking into the blackness, just about the time you start to wonder if a headlamp is required you will see the opening of the South Portal. The tunnel is about 200 yards long and you can see out both portals when standing in the middle third of the tunnel. You can not look completely through the tunnel when standing at the opening to a portal. You can walk standing upright completely through the tunnel, but watch you don't bump your head. As you exit the South Portal, if you look on the west (right) wall you will see some pictographs. Unfortunately the pictographs have been pretty well destroyed with gringo-glyphs.

If you are looking for seclusion inside the National Park this is where you want to be. The route is beginner friendly with competent leadership. A visit to the stunning Covert Arch is part of this route. General Information: Undercover Canyon is a technical canyoneering route that is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. The scenery is dramatic. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 4 hours. Undercover Canyon requires complete technical gear. Undercover Canyon is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. You will need an Arches Canyoneering Permit to enter Undercover Canyon. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. This canyon is accessible year round provided there is no snow on the ground. The exit for this route might be impossible if there is snow on north facing slopes. The route would not be at it's best during the hot summer month's. This canyon should be dry in almost all weather conditions. No wading or swimming is required. The route contains three rappels. The longest rappel is 130-feet. Two 150-foot ropes are required, which will give you plenty of extra rope to reach all anchors. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 75-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Navigation for this route is moderate. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Cisco SW\" and \"Mollie Hogans\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: While this route is located inside Arches National Park it's a long drive to the trailhead because the route is located on the backside of Arches National Park. A four wheel drive is recommended as the roads are often covered with blow sand. The roads are not hardcore four wheeling, but you might encounter short sandy sections in normal driving conditions. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Green River, Utah: Travel east for 18 miles to Crescent Junction (where I-70 meets Highway 191). From Moab, Utah: Travel north on Highway 191 for 30 miles to Crescent Junction (where I-70 meets Highway 191). From Crescent Junction: Follow I-70 east for 11 miles to Exit 193 (N38° 56' 32\", W109° 36' 53\"), signed Yellow Cat. Exit I-70 and turn south. Follow the graded Yellow Cat Road southeast for 6.2 miles to a fork (N38° 52' 04\", W109° 33' 00\"). Take the east (left) fork. Continue following the road for 2.1 miles to the Yellow Cat Mine Ruins (N38° 50' 53\", W109° 31' 42\"). The ruins are located on the east side of the road. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/undercover.htm 1/25/2018 Undercover Canyon - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 From The Yellow Cat Mine Ruins follow the road east for 1.0 mile to a fork (N38° 51' 01\", W109° 30' 38\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 2.6 miles to a fork (N38° 49' 27\", W109° 29' 48\"). Take the east (left) fork and follow the road 3.1 miles to a junction (N38° 48' 31\", W109° 26' 53\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 1.2 miles to a junction (N38° 47' 51\", W109° 26' 06\"), with a less traveled road heading west (right). Carefully driven passenger vehicles and high clearance vehicles can normally reach this junction without problems, beyond this point the roads might contain sections of sand. Follow the less traveled road west for 2.9 miles to where a fence crosses the road. This is the Undercover Canyon Trailhead. Park next to the fence in what is starting to develop into a small parking area. This is also the trailhead for MMI Canyon. Route Information: From the Undercover Canyon Trailhead (N38° 46' 46\", W109° 28' 54\"), start hiking north along the trail that follows the fence. After hiking 1/2 mile from the trailhead the trail swings away from the fence and drops into a shallow wash (N38° 47' 07\", W109° 28' 59\"), once in the bottom of the wash leave the trail and follow the wash northwest (downstream) for 1/2 mile to a junction (N38° 47' 18\", W109° 29' 19\") with a second wash. This is Undercover Canyon, follow the wash downstream and let the fun begin. Most the obstacles along this route consist of minor downclimbing. The first major roadblock is a 40-foot rappel through an interesting little arch. The anchor for this rappel is a bolt high on the north (right) wall of the canyon. It might be difficult to see the anchor and it normally requires a boost to thread the rope. Once at the bottom of the first rappel just head downstream and enjoy the canyon. The second rappel is 90-feet from top to bottom and is anchored by two bolts. From the bottom of the second rappel head downstream, crawl through a cave like section, and you will find yourself on \"The Porch\". This is a nifty platform perched high above the canyon floor below. This is also your third and last rappel. The third rappel is 130-feet and is anchored by two bolts on the north (right) side of the canyon. From the bottom of the third rappel continue downstream until you intersect a major drainage (N38° 47' 02\", W109° 30' 09\"). Among some canyoneers this major drainage is known as MMI Canyon. Hike east (left) up the major drainage for 150-yards to a small drainage entering from the south (right) side of the canyon, this is the exit (N38° 46' 59\", W109° 30' 05\"). Hike up the small drainage to the slickrock, and then continue up the slickrock a short distance until it begins to get steep. The key to the exit is to traverse east (left) approximately 40 yards to a small ledge or seam. You can walk up the slickrock along the seam. This will get you over the steep section of slickrock and allow you to snake your way up the slickrock taking the path of least resistance. You will eventual reach an interesting, 3-foot wide, flat section called \"The Sidewalk\". The Sidewalk is located at the base of the next steep section of slickrock. At this point your eyes will tell you to go east (left), but that is wrong. Follow the Sidewalk west (right) and enjoy strolling along a really cool natural feature. In several places it will appear that The Sidewalk is about to end but it doesn't, just keep following The Sidewalk around a corner to where you can easily exit through the capstone to the canyon rim (N38° 46' 54\", W109° 30' 14\"). Once on top of the canyon rim you will want to visit the impressive Covert Arch (N38° 46' 55\", W109° 30' 22\"). Hike west 200-yards and you will be standing right on top of the arch. It's easy to walk right over the top of the arch and completely miss it if you are not paying attention to its location. From the top of Covert Arch hike 1 1/4 miles in a southeast direction to intersect a 4x4 road (N38° 46' 26\", W109° 29' 17\"). Intersecting the road makes hiking through the sand much easier. Once you intersect the road just follow it northeast for 1/2 mile back to the trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/undercover.htm 1/25/2018 Undercover Canyon - Moab - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 History: The 3,140-acres of Lost Spring Canyon were added to Arches National Park in 1998. The area provides a unique backcountry experience. Since 1985 the Bureau of Land Management had administered the area as a Wilderness Study Area. When Lost Spring Canyon was added to Arches, the Grand Canyon Trust generously purchased the grazing permits and donated them to the National Park Service. Livestock has been removed and is now fenced out improving the backcountry experience. Covert Arch Statistics: Greater Arch Dimension (GAD): 60 feet. For this arch, the LAD is its span. Lesser Arch Dimension (LAD): 32 feet. For this arch, the GAD is its height. Arch Type: Shelter Rock formation and/or type: Navajo Sandstone Video: Enjoy a short video from Undercover Canyon.

This route is a major improvement over the traditional Sunseed Canyon technical route. General Information: Upper Cut Canyon is a technical canyoneering route that contains several entertaining rappels and some interesting scrambling. Upper Cut Canyon requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 hours. Upper Cut Canyon is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is accessible year round, but the route would not be enjoyable during the hot summer month's. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. In normal conditions this canyon does not require any swimming or wading. The route contains several rappels with the longest being 120-feet. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Navigation for this route is moderate. The route does traverse through some major areas of cryptobiotic soil that can be easily avoided with a little care. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moab\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has an extremely small flash flood danger. Trailhead Information: The Upper Cut Trailhead is accessible year round to all vehicles. Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the corner of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 3.6 miles to a gravel spur road (N38° 32' 53\", W109° 35' 35\"), which climbs south from the east (left) side of Kane Creek Drive. Follow the spur road 200-yards to the top of the cut. This is the Upper Cut Trailhead. This is also the trailhead for Lizard Country and Mastodon Canyon. The trailhead is identified by a private residence located 50-yards south of the trailhead. What appears to be a large parking lot is actually half public and half private, stay as far away from the private residence as possible and you will be on public land. Please be considerate of the residence privacy when visiting so we don't lose this access. There is parking for several vehicles at the trailhead. Route Information: From the Upper Cut Trailhead (N38° 32' 47\", W109° 35' 35\"), look southwest and you will see a bench you need to climb to the top of. If you look carefully you will see a cedar tree with a small ledge system next to it that will allow access to the top of the bench. Once on top of the bench walk southeast, under the power lines, and the first canyon you reach is Under Cut (N38° 32' 42\", W109° 35' 28\"). Just start hiking up the drainage and it's pretty difficult to get lost. A social trail is beginning to emerge in the bottom of the drainage, which can make the route a little easier. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/uppercut.htm 1/25/2018 Upper Cut Canyon - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 The Upper Cut drainage contains a couple interesting features and a couple interesting problems to solve. The first interesting feature is about a third of the way up the drainage where you will enter a deep and narrow crosscut section of canyon. The crosscut soon empties into a larger drainage. After entering the larger drainage if you look back it's difficult to see the deep and narrow crosscut you just exited from. Traversing through this crosscut is the key to gaining access to the top of the mesa and is where the route gets it's name. After exiting the crosscut just keep hiking up canyon. You will be presented with several scrambling options that might take a minute to figure out. All the obstacles contain an easy solution, if you encounter major exposure or difficult climbing you are off course. The most difficult obstacle to figure out is about two-thirds of the way up the drainage. If you encounter a 20-foot chimney that would require moderate or better climbing skills to defeat you are in the wrong place. Backtrack approximately 50-yards and take the less obvious north (left) route which appears to dead-end. As you approach the dead-end you will notice a ledge system on the north (left) wall of the canyon that allows you to climb up and over the dead-end and past the top of the chimney. Just keep hiking up canyon and you will soon reach the top at a small saddle, descend the backside of the small saddle and enter Sunseed Canyon (N38° 32' 31\", W109° 34' 45\"). As you enter Sunseed you are presented with a 30-foot wall that can be rappelled using a small tree as your anchor, or simply downclimb using a ledge system to the west (right). Once in the bottom of the Sunseed drainage just follow it downstream, in a southwest direction, bypassing minor obstacles as they present themselves. Soon you will reach a 20-foot drop (N38° 32' 28\", W109° 34' 47\") that can be downclimbed, handlined or rappelled. The downclimb is not as hard as it looks, but if you want to rappel the drop you will need to establish an anchor. Using your best climber as an anchor and than spotting him from below as he downclimbs is a popular option for defeating this obstacle. From the bottom of the 20-foot drop you will be presented with what appears to be a huge drop (N38° 32' 27\", W109° 34' 51\"). The good part about this huge drop is it can be broken into two-stages. The upper stage is 120-feet down to a ledge and is anchored by two bolts on the south (left) canyon wall. The bottom portion of the upper rappel is free-hanging. The bad part about this rappel is you must extend the rappel anchor over the edge or you will not be able to retrieve your ropes from below. This makes the start of the rappel a little scary. The best option is to anchor the ropes up high near the bolts for everyone in the group to create and easy start to the rappel. The last person down can extend the webbing over the edge and be protected from a fall by the group below using a fireman's belay. If you do not take the time to properly anchor this rappel and create a smooth rope pull you might find yourself stranded on the mid-point ledge. The mid-point ledge is an interesting place. The ledge is large enough to comfortably fit a party of 6 or more, but the ledge is exposed. The ledge is about 3-feet wide and 20-feet long and the upper rappel deposits you right in the middle of it. Pictures of this ledge make it look a lot scarier than it actually is, there is plenty of room to work with. The second stage of this rappel is much easier. The second stage is 100-feet and is anchored by two bolts at the south (left) end of the ledge. the bolts are located next to a small tree and create a straightforward rappel down to the canyon floor. Once on the canyon floor simply hike down the stunning canyon. As you exit the canyon you will encounter some overhead power lines. Follow the power lines north (right), back to where you began your adventure earlier in the day. Do not continue hiking west beyond the power lines trying to reach Kane Creek Road as you will be on private property and trespassing. Cryptobiotic Soil: Follow the route described and please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires years of undisturbed growth before it becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/uppercut.htm 1/25/2018 Upper Cut Canyon - Moab - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 Video: Enjoy a short video from Upper Cut Canyon in Moab, Utah.

The route traverses interesting slickrock terrain and visits a location not accessible to your average tourist. As with most of the Moab area canyons the route is best described as an enchanting ramble. General Information: U-Turn is a technical canyoneering route that is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. The scenery is dramatic. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 2 hours. U-Turn requires complete technical gear. U-Turn is rated 3A I using the Canyon Rating System. You will need an Arches Canyoneering Permit to enter U-Turn. In normal conditions the route should be completely dry. The route consists four rappels with the highest being 80-feet. I suggest a 60-meter rope and a minimum of 50-feet of webbing for this route. The rappels are easy to rig and anchors are abundant. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"The Windows Section\" and \"Moab\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for U-Turn use the WGS84 datum. This route has an extremely minor flash flood danger. This canyon is accessible year round, unless snow is on the ground. The route would be miserable during the hot part of the summer day. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. It is of value to note that Tierdrop, Not Tierdrop and U-Turn all use the same trailhead. This makes completing a combo platter of any combination of the canyons easy to complete in a single day. Trailhead Information: From Arches National Park Visitor Center drive into the park for 2.1 miles to the signed Park Avenue Trailhead and Viewpoint. Park in the large, paved, parking lot on the north (left) side of the road. The trailhead easily accommodates a large number of vehicles. There is no restroom at the trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: From the Park Avenue Trailhead and Viewpoint (N38° 37' 27\", W109° 36' 00\") walk west on the main road for about 75-yards to a combination small wash and use trail on the north side of the road. Follow the use trail west to the back corner of the massive cliffs. Hidden in the corner you will find the crack approach (N38° 37' 24\", W109° 36' 17\"). Scramble up the crack to the small saddle (N38° 37' 26\", W109° 36' 20\"). Once you are in the small saddle do not descend, instead turn east (right) and follow the ridge. Walk east along the ridge 40-yards and you will come to Dome #1, you can bypass this dome using a ledge system on the north (left) side. Once around Dome #1 you will immediately encounter Dome #2 (see route photo). At first glance Dome #2 appears impossible to get around but if you walk right up to the front of it you will discover you can walk right over the top of it. Once you are over the top of Dome #2 look on the south (right) side of the ridge and you will see the beginning of a canyon. This is the top of U-Turn (N38° 37' 28\", W109° 36' 15\"). We call it U-Turn because the canyon starts on the south side of the ridge and forms a U turn around the cliff and exits onto the slickrock heading north. The first drop is only 10-feet and has been downclimbed by the skilled. The anchor for the first drop is hidden. It consists of a single bolt that is hidden under the front of the big boulder on the west (right) side of the small slickrock bowl. Why this was ever bolted I have no clue, maybe for aesthetic reasons, as the anchor is in front of a slingable boulder. The second rappel is 15-feet. The anchor for this rappel consists of two bolts. The bolts are hidden on the north (left) side of the canyon up behind the two toadstools. From the bottom of the second rappel you can walk out onto the large slickrock face. The third rappel requires that you sling one of the many boulders and rappel 40-feet down the slickrock to the next level. Those who want to do a little exploring should be able to located a crack downclimb that will eliminate the third rappel. Side Trip: From the bottom of the third rappel if you walk right (east), along the slickrock bench, you will reach \"Wily E. Coyote\" Rock. It's a great geologic formation to investigate. Now back on track: From the bottom of the third rappel walk north along the slickrock until you are directly above where the main drainage is forming down below. The fourth rappel is anchored from a large boulder or two bolts and is 80-feet high. Rappel directly down where the main drainage is forming. From the bottom of the fourth rappel follow the base of the cliff east and than southeast. By constantly keeping the cliff to your immediate right you should be able to contour along the wide slickrock ledge. Eventually the contouring slickrock ledge will deposit you right at the trailhead. Flying Under the Radar: Recently it has become popular to sling a boulder near Wily E. Coyote Rock for the fourth and final rappel. This rappel is approximately 85-feet http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/uturn.htm 1/25/2018 U-Turn - Arches National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 and deposits you on a slickrock bench just north of the Park Avenue Trailhead and Viewpoint. Using this rappel anchor might eventual cause conflicts with the Park Service as the rappel is highly visible from the tourist saturated viewpoint and trail. As a canyoneering community it's up to us to police ourselves and stay under the NPS radar by continuing to use the final rappel anchor in the natural drainage that is not visible to the average tourist. If this route becomes a problem for Arches NP you can expect to see tighter regulations. Cryptobiotic Soil: Follow the route described and you will avoid areas of cryptobiotic crust. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth. Video: Enjoy a short video from U-Turn.

It's easy to spend a couple hours or the whole day exploring the maze of tunnels and passages. General Information: The Moab Wind Caves are an entertaining way to spend a half-a-day or more in the Moab backcountry. This adventure is accessible year-round in good weather. Reaching the Moab Wind Caves requires four wheel drive. Actual driving time from Moab to the Wind Caves is approximately 90 minutes each way. The route follows one of the more popular and easier four wheel drives trails in the Moab Area. The route is suitable for most stock high clearance pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles with four wheel drive. The roads are not hardcore four wheeling, but you will encounter several minor obstacles, which will require careful tire placement. This route crosses Kane Creek, which can be deep water in early spring and after heavy rains. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Shafer Basin\", \"Trough Springs Canyon\" and \"Moab\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Camping is available at numerous locations along the route, but only in designated camp sites while inside the Colorado River Waterway boundary. Fees are required and vault toilets are provided. Beyond the Colorado River Waterway boundary rules are much more lax and numerous primitive camp sites exist. Route Information: The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Locate the McDonald's at the south end of Moab on the comer of Main Street and Kane Creek Drive. Follow Kane Creek Drive west for 4.7 miles to where the pavement ends at a cattle guard (N38° 32' 03\", W109° 36' 00\"). From the cattle guard follow the well maintained dirt road south for 6.7 miles to a signed junction (N38° 27' 57\", W109° 36' 02\"). The south (left) fork continues to follow Kane Creek. Take the west (right) fork towards Hurrah Pass. From the signed junction follow the road for 3.0 miles as it climbs to the top of Hurrah Pass (N38° 28' 55\", W109° 37' 30\"). Once you are at the top of Hurrah Pass continue to follow the road west as it descends the other side. From Hurrah Pass follow the road for 2.5 miles to an unsigned junction (N38° 28' 15\", W109° 38' 58\"), The fork to the east (right) leads to the Jackson Hole Trail. The trail to the west is the Lockhart Basin Road. Turn west (left) and follow the Lockhart Basin Road for 1.8 miles to a junction (N38° 27' 21\", W109° 40' 04\"). The road to the west (straight ahead) is the Lockhart Basin Road. The road to the south (left) is the Dripping Springs Road. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/windcave.htm 1/25/2018 Wind Caves - Moab Page 2 of 2 Turn south (left) on the Dripping Springs road and follow it for 0.4 miles to the Moab Wind Caves (N38° 27' 03\", W109° 39' 55\"). The caves are in the massive rock formation and are easy to locate. Exploring the Caves: You will want a good headlamp or flashlight to explore the bowels of this massive rock out cropping. I really don't think you could get lost or stuck inside the caves, provided you use good judgment and commonsense. There a numerous passages and openings. Some routes are easy walking and some require climbing, crawling and scrambling. With careful route finding and a desire to explore its possible to pass completely through the center of the massive rock outcropping from one side to the other using various interconnected passageways. The Moab Wind Caves provide entertainment for the entire family.

As technical routes go they don't get much easier than this one. The obstacles are all easy to defeat and the scenery is outstanding. The route is beginner friendly with competent leadership. General Information: Winter Camp Slot is a technical canyoneering route that is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 hours. Winter Camp Slot requires complete technical gear. Winter Camp Slot is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is accessible year round. This is an excellent winter and cold weather route. This canyon should be dry in almost all weather conditions. No wading or swimming is required. The route contains one rappel of 190-feet. Two 200-foot ropes are required, or you can use one 200-foot rope and retrieve it after you complete the route, which is what I recommend. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 25-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Navigation for this route is easy. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Cisco SW\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: While this route is located just outside of Arches National Park it's a long drive to the trailhead because the route is located on the backside of Arches National Park. A four wheel drive is recommended as the roads are often covered with blow sand. The roads are not hardcore four wheeling, but you might encounter short sandy sections in normal driving conditions. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Green River, Utah: Travel east for 18 miles to Crescent Junction (where I-70 meets Highway 191). From Moab, Utah: Travel north on Highway 191 for 30 miles to Crescent Junction (where I-70 meets Highway 191). From Crescent Junction: Follow I-70 east for 11 miles to Exit 193 (N38° 56' 32\", W109° 36' 53\"), signed Yellow Cat. Exit I-70 and turn south. Follow the graded Yellow Cat Road southeast for 6.2 miles to a fork (N38° 52' 04\", W109° 33' 00\"). Take the east (left) fork. Continue following the road for 2.1 miles to the Yellow Cat Mine Ruins (N38° 50' 53\", W109° 31' 42\"). The ruins are located on the east side of the road. From The Yellow Cat Mine Ruins follow the road east for 1.0 mile to a fork (N38° 51' 01\", W109° 30' 38\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 2.6 miles to a fork (N38° 49' 27\", W109° 29' 48\"). Take the east (left) fork and follow the road 3.1 miles to a junction (N38° 48' 31\", W109° 26' 53\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road 1.2 miles to a junction http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/wintercamp.htm 1/25/2018 Winter Camp Slot - Moab - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 (N38° 47' 51\", W109° 26' 06\"), with a less traveled road heading west (right). Carefully driven passenger vehicles and high clearance vehicles can normally reach this junction without problems; beyond this point the roads might contain sections of sand. Follow the less traveled road west for 0.5 miles to where you can pull off the road next to a cedar tree. This is the Winter Camp Slot Trailhead. Route Information: From the Winter Camp Slot Trailhead (N38° 47' 37\", W109° 26' 36\"), hike east on the road you drove in on for 1/4 mile to just past a bend (N38° 47' 41\", W109° 26' 17\"), at which time you leave the road and head directly south. Hike south for 250-yards into the bottom of a wash, follow the wash downstream (west) a very short distance and you will encounter the only rappel on the route (N38° 47' 34\", W109° 26' 19\"). This rappel is 190-feet from the canyon rim to the canyon floor. The rappel is anchored by webbing around a large tree just to the north (right) of the watercourse. The rappel drops approximately 70-feet into a large sand filled pothole and than continues an additional 120-feet to the canyon floor. It is suggested that you leave your rope and retrieve it when you leave, as the rope pull from the bottom could be problematic. Once at the bottom of the rappel hike downstream and enjoy the splendor. Most of the time you will be walking in a narrow slot canyon that is completely void of any obstacles. In fact, the compete lack of obstacles will be one of the points of interest to experienced canyoneers who are accustomed to fighting their way through similar slot canyons. The highlight of this route is the deep slot and swirling sandstone sculptures. From the base of the rappel hike downstream for approximately one mile to where the canyon begins to open up and a small grove of cottonwood trees is located (N38° 47' 02\", W109° 26' 57\"), this is your exit. Climb out of the canyon to the north (right) and hike 1/2 mile north to a dirt road (N38° 47' 27\", W109° 27' 06\"). Once you intersect the dirt road follow it 1/2 mile east (right) back to the trailhead. Hiker Notes: Hikers can explore a large portion of this slot canyon by reversing the route described. This route is an outstanding opportunity for hikers to visit a beautiful slot canyon.

This is the perfect route for those wanting more than just a simple hike. Several different route options are provided to allow you to customize the route to your skill level and desires. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Three options for visiting Yellow Comet are presented below, they are the Crawl Route, the Stock Route and the Loop Route. All three routes have their charms and disadvantages. The pictograph panel can be visited in all weather conditions provided there is no snow on the ground. Do not attempt this route if there is snow. The route would be miserable during the hot summer month's as there is no shade. This is a desert environment, every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of at least two liters of water. If you are after a great photograph you probably want to visit the panel in the late afternoon when it moves into the shade. During the morning hours the panel is in the direct sunlight and obtaining a good photograph is nearly impossible. All route options are rated 1A III using the Canyon Rating System. Navigation for this route is moderate. There are no established trails, but social trails are emerging through the more challenging areas, which makes navigation easier. The route does traverse through some areas of cryptobiotic soil but they are easy to avoid with a little care. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Dubinky Wash\" and \"The Knoll\" are essential. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Crawl Route General Information: This is the shortest and most direct route to reach Yellow Comet. A round trip using this option is approximately 3 hours trailhead to trailhead. The route is not as scary as you would assume or as the pictures would suggest. The ledges are all 5 to 6 feet wide so you have plenty of room for comfort and the tightest section of the 100-foot crawl is approximately 3 feet high. This route does involve a moderate amount of easy scrambling with little exposure. Stock Route General Information: In the past this has been the most popular route for reaching Yellow Comet. This is the longest of the routes presented. A round trip using this option is approximately 5 hours trailhead to trailhead. The down-side to this route is it involves a several miles of slogging through the sand. The up-side to the route is marveling at the fact the early ranchers actually took cattle up and down the old stock trail. This is probably the easiest of all the routes presented, but it does involve one short section of simple scrambling across slickrock that can be a little unnerving for beginning hikers because of the exposure. Loop Route General Information: This is my preferred option for visiting Yellow Comet as you get to enjoy the full meal http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/yellowcomet.htm 1/25/2018 Yellow Comet - Hell Roaring Canyon - Pictographs Page 2 of 3 deal with ever changing scenery. A round trip using this option is approximately 4 hours trailhead to trailhead. The only down-side to this option is it requires a short car or mountain bike shuttle. Trailhead Information: Yellow Comet is located just outside of Moab on the road to Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands Island in the Sky District. During normal conditions any carefully driven passenger car should be able to reach both the Crawl Route and Stock Route trailheads. From Moab head north out of town on U.S. Highway 191. Cross the bridge over the Colorado River. After crossing the bridge continue north for 8.3 miles to the junction with State Road 313, signed Dead Horse Point and Canyonlands. Turn west (left) on State Road 313 and follow it for 8.5 miles to mile marker 14.0 (N38° 37' 43\", W109° 48' 06\"). Turn north (right) on the unsigned, but well-maintained BLM 137/Dubinky Well Road. Follow the Dubinky Well Road for 1.5 miles to a signed fork in the road (N38° 38' 33\", W109° 49' 15\"). Take the west (left) fork and continue straight on BLM 140/Hey Joe Canyon Safari Road for 2.2 miles to a cattle guard (N38° 38' 10\", W109° 51' 40\"). Crawl Route Trailhead: to reach the Crawl Route Trailhead (upper trailhead) you must turn south (left) at the cattle guard and follow a small dirt road 0.3 miles south to where the road ends at a large slickrock parking area with great views into Hell Roaring Canyon. This is the Crawl Route Trailhead. Stock Route Trailhead: to reach the Stock Route Trailhead (lower trailhead) you must continue west (straight ahead) at the cattle guard and drive an additional 1.7 miles to where a small dirt roads heads south (N38° 38' 06\", W109° 53' 38\"). Turn south (left) on the small dirt road and follow it for 0.1 miles to where the road ends at a large slickrock parking area. This is the Stock Route Trailhead. Crawl Route: From the Crawl Route Trailhead (N38° 37' 59\", W109° 51' 52\") take a moment and look south across the canyon and identify the crawl route using the picture on the provided map. Studying the route from the trailhead for a few minutes will make navigation and route finding very easy. Once you have the route figured out hike 1/3 mile south along the canyon rim to the top of the Crawl Route (N38° 37' 45\", W109° 51' 55\"). Scramble down from the canyon rim to the ledge the crawl is located on. This short easy scramble down to the ledge is the most difficult obstacle on the route. Once you have locate the crawl make your way through and route find your way to the canyon bottom. Once through the crawl there are no more difficult sections, if you find yourself in a difficult spot just look around and you will find an easier option. Once you have reached the canyon bottom hike east down Hell Roaring Canyon for 1/2 mile to the Yellow Comet Pictograph Panel (N38° 37' 42\", W109° 52' 22\"). The panel is located on the north canyon wall, at the back of the alcove, above a talus field. You must scramble to the top of the talus field to visit the panel. Stock Route: From the Stock Route Trailhead (N38° 38' 00\", W109° 53' 40\"), hike south 1/3 mile to the top of the Stock Route (N38° 37' 41\", W109° 53' 46\"). Follow the stock trail as it snakes its way down from the canyon rim. Near the top of the stock trail there is one short section of exposed slickrock you must cross that experienced hikers will have no problem with, but the section can be a little unnerving to those unfamiliar with off trail hiking. Once you reach the bottom of Dubinky Wash (N38° 37' 47\", W109° 53' 56\") turn south (left) and follow the canyon 1 mile to Hell Roaring Canyon (N38° 37' 14\", W109° 54' 25\"). Once you have reached Hell Roaring Canyon turn east (left) and hike up canyon for 2 1/2 miles to the Yellow Comet Pictograph Panel (N38° 37' 42\", W109° 52' 22\"). The panel is located on the north canyon wall, at the back of the alcove, above a talus field. You must scramble to the top of the talus field to visit the panel. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/yellowcomet.htm 1/25/2018 Yellow Comet - Hell Roaring Canyon - Pictographs Page 3 of 3 Loop Route: This is the best option if you have the opportunity. The route can be completed in either direction, but the route finding is probably slightly easier if you start at the Crawl Trailhead and finish at the Stock Trailhead. For some reason the thought of the crawl intimidates some people and doing the crawl first thing in the morning eliminates that concern for the remainder of the day. Cryptobiotic Soil: The routes desired do cross areas of cryptobiotic crust. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires years of undisturbed growth before it becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth.

The beauty of this canyon is spectacular; the narrows are deep, tight, dramatic and fun. Blarney Canyon offers its enchantment with only a short approach hike. The canyon has two technical routes, which are divided into the Right (East) Fork and Left (West) Fork. General Information: Blarney Canyon is a marvelous technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon is divided into two sections, the Right Fork and Left Fork. The Right Fork is the easier of the two options while the Left Fork is more enchanting. I recommend a group size of 6 or less. Hikers can enjoy the bottom portion of Blarney Canyon. It is easy to hike up the canyon bottom and enjoy long stretches of narrows. There are good primitive campsites in the area of the trailhead. Blarney Canyon requires complete technical gear. There is possible wading but no swimming required in normal conditions. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A 100-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate natural anchors, which is not difficult in this canyon. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Turkey Knob\" are essential. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. Check the local weather report before committing. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 27 miles. At mile marker 27.6 there is a culvert under the road next to a small spur road. Drive 100 feet to the end of the spur road. This is the trailhead. There are several nice primitive campsites in the area. The most popular campsite with the canyoneering community is often referred to as the Sandthrax Campground and is located at Mile Marker 28.3 midway between the trailhead to Leprechaun Canyon and Sandthrax Canyon. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38° 01' 13\", W110° 32' 41\"), the approach route climbs up the ridge to the west (left) of Blarney Canyon. This ridge is also the approach route to Shillelagh Canyon. There is no trail and moderate route finding is required. There is no climbing involved if you carefully choose your route up the ridge. A hiker made trail is beginning to emerge along part of this route. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/blarney.htm 1/25/2018 Blarney Canyon - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 The easiest method of reaching the drop in point of your intended slot is to keep hiking up the ridge until reaching the relatively flat cap above the canyons. Once you reach the cap it is easy to hike cross-country to your intended destination. Be extremely careful that you are dropping into the correct drainage. At least one rescue has resulted from a navigational error. The cap can be confusing and all the canyons look similar from the top. Right (East) Fork: The Right Fork is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total descent time is approximately 3 hours car to car. The drop-in point for the Right Fork (N38° 01' 53\", W110° 32' 10\") is a large bowl with no walk down. I refer to this as the toilet bowl since everything that enters the bowl will be flushed down the canyon. Pick any of a number of natural anchors and rappel 30-feet into the toilet bowl. Be careful, most the rock around the rim of the toilet bowl is rotten. From the bottom of the toilet bowl head down canyon, skilled climbers can downclimb the remaining canyon; others will require at least one more short 20-foot rappel. There are no major difficulties in the remaining canyon, just a bunch of squeezing, downclimbing and scrambling. Left (West) Fork: The Left Fork is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total descent time is approximately 3 hours car to car. The drop-in point for the Left Fork (N38° 02' 02\", W110° 32' 20\") is a bowl with no walk down. Pick any of the easy to locate natural anchors and rappel the short distance into the bowl. From this point just head down canyon. There is plenty of fun to be had for all. The only major obstacle remaining is a 45-rappel about 1/4 of the way down canyon. This drop/chimney can be downclimbed by the highly skilled but I suggest all others use a rope. There are no major difficulties in the remaining canyon, just a bunch of squeezing, downclimbing and scrambling. Video: Enjoy a short HD video from the West (Left) Fork of Blarney Canyon in North Wash. Hiking Notes: If you are not into technical canyoneering but would enjoy visiting a fun, photographic slot canyon this is a great place. From the trailhead, just hike up the canyon until stopped by an obstacle. A large portion of this canyon can be enjoyed by hiking the lower sections. There are plenty of slots and narrows to explore that are easily accessible to hikers.

The narrows are hair raising and risky. Boss Hog features what is known as a \"Mae West Slot\", which is a slot so narrow that it is impossible to pass through. This feature forces you to climb up and over the obstacle. Boss Hog ends with an enchanting hike down a lush green canyon to a wonderful waterfall and plunge pool. The canyon offers its seductiveness with only a short approach hike. Any descent of this canyon requires intermediate or better rock climbing skills. Boss Hog is the finest route of the upper Hog Springs system. This route combines well with Hog 2 and Hog 3 (Razorback), which are also included in this route description. These canyons can be combined to create a full day of Colorado Plateau canyoneering. Warning: Every member of your group must be a skilled canyoneer. This canyon could be deadly for beginners, even with advanced leadership. The following description is not a substitute for commonsense and experience. Do not underestimate the difficulty of descending this canyon. To safely descend this canyon every member of your group must be able to climb at a level of 5.7 or above. Boss Hog is rated 3A R II using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. A rescue in this canyon would be dangerous and extremely difficult. General Information: Boss Hog is an astounding technical canyoneering adventure. Good rock climbing skills are required. Boss Hog requires complete technical gear. This canyon is usually dry with perhaps some knee deep wading in normal conditions. This canyon is easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Bring as small and light of pack as possible. This route can be done with or without a shuttle vehicle. A vehicle shuttle is required to complete this route in the preferred method. Assuming that both shuttle vehicles are 4 wheel drive it takes approximately 20 minutes to drive the 13 miles between the Lower and Upper Trailheads. The shuttle can be accomplished with passenger cars or high clearance vehicles with differing amounts of success. The lack of 4 wheel drive will add approximately 2 miles of hiking and 45 minutes of time to the route depending on road conditions. Mae West canyons also require the use of a \"mae west bunny\" or bunny strap. This is a length of webbing or a daisy chain with a carabiner attached which will allow you to hang your pack from your harness while you chimney, climb and stem above and through the narrow slots. A bunny strap is a must have item. I prefer a daisy chain since it allows much more adjustment in where and how you attach your pack. I recommend a group size of 4 or less because the final rappel station is small without a nice place for a group to hangout. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 4 to 5 hours. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bosshog.htm 1/25/2018 Boss Hog - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 5 This is a physical canyon requiring constant downclimbing, wading, climbing, stemming and chimneying. This canyon has three rappels, the longest being 50 feet. Those with excellent climbing and partner assist skills might be able to eliminate a couple of rappels. A 100-foot rope is required. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchor and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. I strongly suggest a long sleeve shirt and long pants for this slot or you will leave some skin on the canyon walls. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Black Table\" and \"Hite, North\" are essential. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. Lower Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive 33 miles south on highway 95 to mile marker 33.1. This is the Lower Trailhead and it is known as Hog Spring Picnic Area. The trailhead is easy to find and is marked with a large paved pull-out, covered picnic tables, garbage bin, informative signs, restrooms and a charming suspended bridge over the river. This is where you must leave your shuttle vehicle. Upper Trailhead Information: From the Lower Trailhead drive north on highway 95 for 7.2 miles to the signed turn-off to State Road 276 and Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell. Follow State Road 276 south for 3 1/2 miles to mile marker 3.6. At this point you will encounter a dirt road heading east (N37° 58' 24\", W110° 34' 05\"). Those with a passenger car must park here and begin walking. Those with 4 wheel drive can drive out the dirt road for 2.1 miles to the trailhead. The trailhead is easily distinguished because the dirt road climbs a small knoll and makes a sharp turn to the south. The Upper Trailhead is located at this sharp bend in the road. Condition of the dirt road varies. 4 wheel drive vehicles will have no problem accessing this trailhead. High clearance vehicles should be able to reach this trailhead in normal conditions. Passenger cars should be parked along side highway 276. The actual trailhead is not accessible to passenger cars. Route Information: From the Upper Trailhead (N37° 58' 21\", W110° 31' 50\"), begin hiking cross-country in a northeast direction for 1 1/4 miles. After hiking for about 30 minutes across open sandy terrain you should reach the head of Boss Hog. The head of the canyon is very distinct and easy to identify from a distance. Approximately 300 yards before actually reaching the head of Boss Hog you will notice a break in the rimrock that allows a scramble to the canyon bottom (N37° 59' 08\", W110° 31' 07\"). Except this opportunity and scramble down through the first band of cliffs. After reaching the bottom of Boss Hog start hiking downstream. The top of the canyon contains a few minor obstacles as you begin your journey. After a short distance you will encounter the first major obstacle in the canyon. This is a 20-foot rappel or a very difficult downclimb with high penalty points, you make the call. The anchor is a slung Ballard at the lip of the pour-over. 15 yards past the first rappel you will reach the second rappel. You can downclimb this section with a partner assist but if you already have the rope out you might as http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bosshog.htm 1/25/2018 Boss Hog - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 3 of 5 well be safe and use it. The second rappel is in two stages, 45 feet total. The anchor is a slung boulder to the right (LDC). Below this there are a couple of narrow Mae West sections where it is easier to stay high and stem or chimney rather than drop to the bottom. The first section is about 60 feet long. The second section of Mae West is more difficult to describe. When you reach a point where the canyon drops 25-feet into a tight narrows and bends to the left. There's a boulder jammed into the crack about 6-feet from the edge at your level. At first you will think \"downclimb\", but you are better off staying high. If you drop down you will be forced to climb back up in a difficult spot. If in doubt, stay high. About midway through the second section of Mae West you will you will notice a couple of large boulders at the end of the section. This will be the anchor for the third and final rappel. After the third rappel continue down canyon and enjoying some relaxed narrows for about 15 minutes. The last problem is a 30-foot downclimb into a narrow chimney. It's tight but not difficult or a trap. From the end of the narrows hike down stream 1/4 mile to where a canyon enters from the northwest around a very prominent nose (N37° 58' 35\", W110° 31' 10\"). This is an alternate exit back to the rim for those without a car shuttle. From the alternate exit hike downstream 1/4 mile and you will encounter Hog Spring (N37° 58' 27\", W110° 30' 59\"). It's nice to finally get to the water on a hot day but you will be forced to do some bushwhacking from here to the waterfall, which is still 1 mile down canyon. Take a minute and enjoy the Hog Spring Waterfall (N37° 57' 53\", W110° 30' 27\"). This oasis in the desert is very angelic. From the waterfall, continue hiking down canyon for an additional mile to the Hog Spring Picnic Area (N37° 57' 46\", W110° 29' 29\"). Alternate Route Information: It is possible to do Boss Hog without a car shuttle from either the Lower or Upper Trailhead. Both routes involve using the same alternate exit to the canyon rim. Both routes still retain the 3A R II rating using the Canyon Rating System. The Upper Trailhead is the shorter and easier of the two routes. 1/4 mile below where the tight narrows end or 1/4 mile above Hog Spring you will notice a canyon entering from the northwest around a very prominent nose (N37° 58' 35\", W110° 31' 10\"). This canyon is an alternate route to the canyon rim for those without a car shuttle. The alternate exit is steep third class all the way up the gully until you get right to the top of it. There's a 15-foot section of sandstone cliff, which you must route find and scramble through. The rock is rotten so be sure of your handholds. From the top of the cliff band you can either head to the Upper Trailhead (N37° 58' 21\", W110° 31' 50\") or to the start of Boss Hog (N37° 59' 08\", W110° 31' 07\"). 5th Class Exit: There is a 5th class exit between Boss Hog and Hog 2. The intersection of Boss Hog and Hog 2 (N37° 58' 39\", W110° 31' 12\") is where the exit begins. The 5th class exit that will take you up the nose between Boss Hog and Hog 2. This exit requires slabby 5.7 climbing moves for the first 25-feet to gain the ridge between Boss Hog and Hog 2. After gaining the ridge, you can follow it back up to the rim and then go to the start of either Boss Hog, Hog 2 or Hog 3. This is the most efficient exit to use if you plan on doing more than one of the Hog Canyons on the same day. Hog 2 Information: Hog 2 is rated 3A II. Wetsuits are not required as the route contains little water in normal http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bosshog.htm 1/25/2018 Boss Hog - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 4 of 5 conditions. The longest rappel in the canyon is 130-feet and requires two 130-foot ropes. Hog 2 drops sharply and has 4 noticeable left turns during its descent. From the head of Boss Hog hike 400-yards east to the head of Hog 2 (N37° 59' 06\", W110° 30' 55\") and scramble down into the drainage and head downstream. At the first hard left turn, you will come to the first rappel. The first rappel is 130-feet and is anchored from a rock cairn. Alternately, the first rappel can be bypassed by skilled canyoneers if you traverse to the left over the nose on the left side of the canyon (LDC) and downclimb the elevator crack. This bypass does require some exposed slab moves to get into the crack. At the 3rd left-turn section, you will come upon the second rappel, which most groups will want to do as two smaller rappels. The second rappel is a two-stage affair that drops a total of 60-feet. The anchor is a pinch between the canyon wall and a boulder. This is soon followed by the third rappel that is 60-feet, slightly overhung, and anchored from a chokestone. This rappel deposits you at the edge of a pothole. This is followed by couple sections of narrows before arriving at the 4th left turn and the key feature of the route some refer to as the \"Birth Canal\". The Birth Canal will drop you into a pothole that might contain water. Sometimes there was a rappel anchor set up for the Birth Canal drop, but it can also be downclimbed. The downclimb is easier if you stay above the Birth Canal bombay and complete the downclimb past the bombay instead of going down in the bombay. From the Birth Canal hike downstream a short distance to where Hog 2 joins the Main Hog Springs Drainage (N37° 58' 39\", W110° 31' 12\"). Hog 3 Information: Hog 3 is also known as \"Razorback\" and is rated 3A II R. The route earns its R-rating because of the high stemming involved. In places you will find yourself stemming 30-feet up as the route along the canyon floor does not allow passage because it is to narrow. Wetsuits are not required as the route contains little water in normal conditions. The longest rappel in the canyon is 75-feet and requires a 50-meter (165-foot) rope. The slot has one mandatory rappel for the highly skilled, others will require more rappels or a belay. In several places along this route you will find sharp protrusions of sandstone that have a habit of sticking you, which is where the Razorback name originated from. From the head of Hog 2 hike 1/3 mile southeast to the head of Hog 3 (N37° 58' 51\", W110° 30' 44\") and head downstream. The first major obstacle is some high stemming 30-feet off the deck in a section of mae west slot. Through this section of mae west slot you will encounter two S-turns that make the high stemming a little tricky. During this section there is a tricky downclimb that may have a rappel anchor. If rappelling this drop, it is about a 30-foot drop from the end of the anchor, but most will be able to get into a good stemming position after 15-feet. If using the rappel, it is recommended that the last person stem 15-feet below the drop and pull the rope from there to minimize rope grooving. This downclimb or rappel is followed by a short section of walking, followed by scrambling, followed by a second section of stemming. This is followed by a short walk to a corridor that can occasionally have a pool of waist deep water. Tall canyoneers can bridge the pool with some effort. Vertically challenged canyoneers are getting wet. After the pool and a short walk is the only mandatory rappel in the slot. The actual rappel is 75-feet, but the anchor is a chokestone located 20-feet upstream in a constriction. You might be required to extend your anchor webbing to the edge of the rappel to create a good rope pull. Below the rappel you will find a section of scrambling through a boulder field and some bushwhacking through a riparian section before Hog 3 joins the Main Hog Springs Drainage (N37° 58' 27\", W110° 30' 59\"). Mind your step in the riparian section and watch out for poison ivy. There is a lot of poison ivy intermixed in the riparian vegetation at the bottom of Hog 3. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bosshog.htm 1/25/2018 Boss Hog - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 5 of 5 Most of this can be avoided if you traverse high on the right side of the canyon and stay out of the canyon bottom.

This canyon combines perfectly with other slot canyons located in the North Wash area to create a great day of Colorado Plateau style canyoneering. General Information: Hogwarts Canyon is a short slot canyon that requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 2 hours. Hogwarts is rated 3A I using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. Under normal conditions you might encounter knee to waist deep wading, which can usually be stemmed and bridged by climbers with mediocre skills. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. The longest rappel in this canyon is 85-feet. A 200-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which is not difficult in this canyon and should be considered as part of the fun. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Hite North\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Hogwarts Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a minor flash flood danger. Check the local weather before committing. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 33 miles to mile marker 33.1. This is the Hog Springs Trailhead. The trailhead is identified by a large paved pull-out, covered picnic tables, garbage bin, informative signs, restrooms and a charming suspended bridge over the river. Route Information: From the Hog Springs Trailhead (N37° 57' 46\", W110° 29' 29\"), cross the river on the suspended bridge and follow the hiker trail west as it follows the stream up Hog Canyon towards the Hog Springs Waterfall. After crossing the suspension bridge and hiking 75-yards towards the Hog Springs Waterfall you will see a side canyon (N37° 57' 42\", W110° 29' 36\") entering from the south (left). Just to the east (left) of the side canyon, and running parallel to it you will see a gulley. You want to scramble up the gulley, as this is the easiest approach to the top of Hogwarts. The gulley requires some minor bushwhacking, but it's not to bad. From the top of the gulley make your way south to the top of the ridge and descend a rocky gulley to the head of Hogwarts Canyon (N37° 57' 27\", W110° 29' 17\"). Follow Hogwarts downstream and enjoy the ride. The first major obstacle is the first rappel, which is 40-feet and anchored from a large boulder. This is soon followed by the second rappel, which is 80-feet. The second rappel descends through the most significant feature along the route, which is a magnificent natural bridge. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/hogwarts.htm 1/25/2018 Hogwarts Canyon - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 Next up might be the most interesting obstacle in the slot canyon, which is a semi-keeper pothole. There are two common methods of defeating this obstacle. The first is to stem over the top of the pothole. Most canyoneers with mediocre climbing skills should be able to stem this obstacle, but a fall does come with major penalty points. The second method is to work through the semi-keeper pothole. The semi-keeper is normally defeated with a pack toss and/or partner assist. Pick your poison. Next up is a tight narrow section followed by the third rappel, which is 70-feet and anchored from two hueco's.. Followed soon after by the fourth rappel, which is 85-feet and free hanging. From the bottom of the fourth rappel hike down to the highway (N37° 57' 39\", W110° 29' 09\"), At the highway turn north (left) and hike 1/2 mile back to the Hog Springs Trailhead. Rock Art Information: There are two panels of Native American rock art near the Hog Spring trailhead. The best panel is a pictograph (N37° 57' 40\", W110° 29' 19\") located in a large alcove, on the west side of the stream, 200 yards downstream from the Hog Spring Picnic Area. This pictograph is sometimes referred to as the \"Moki Maiden\" or \"Cleopatra\". The second panel containing a few small, faded and vandalized petroglyphs (N37° 57' 45\", W110° 29' 17\") is located across the highway from the large alcove noted above. Hog Springs Waterfall Information: From the Hog Springs Trailhead, cross the river on the suspended bridge and follow the trail west as it follows the stream up Hog Canyon. Just keep following the stream for approximately 1 mile (30 minutes) and you will reach a beautiful waterfall and plunge pool (N37° 57' 53\", W110° 30' 27\"). The waterfall is formed where the stream flows through the Kayenta sandstone layer. Video: Enjoy a short video of Hogwarts Canyon in North Wash compliments of Blake Merrell.

The beauty of this canyon is spectacular; the narrows are extremely tight, dramatic, unrelenting and perilous. The canyon offers its enchantment with only a short approach hike. Leprechaun Canyon is the crown jewel and centerpiece of a group of canyons commonly referred to as the \"Irish Canyons\". Leprechaun Canyon offers a variety of routes to fit all skill levels from beginner to expert. The Middle Fork of Leprechaun Canyon features what has become known as a \"Mae West Slot\", which is a \"V\" shaped slot so narrow that it is impossible to pass through. Descent requires moderate rock climbing skills to climb over or bypass the \"Mae West\" portions of the canyon. General Information: Leprechaun Canyon is a spectacular technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon is divided into three sections, the Right Fork (Upper Leprechaun), Middle Fork (Shimrock) and Left Fork (Shamrock). I strongly suggest that you do the Right Fork of Leprechaun before attempting the Left Fork or the more hazardous Middle Fork. I recommend a group size of 6 or less. This is a physical canyon requiring constant downclimbing, squeezing, stemming and chimneying. Good rock climbing skills are a bonus. Fat guys and buxom woman are going to find it impossibly difficult in the Middle and Left Forks because of the tight squeezes. The bottom portion of Leprechaun Canyon can be enjoyed by hikers and includes several unique features including two narrow slots and a section of subway. Leprechaun Canyon requires complete technical gear. Under normal conditions you will encounter knee to waist deep wading but no swimming. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A 100 foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, a prusik system and a headlamp are required. Mae West canyons also require the use of a \"mae west bunny\" or bunny strap. This is a length or webbing or a daisy chain with a carabiner attached that will allow you to hang your pack from your harness while you chimney, climb and stem above and through the narrow slots. A bunny strap is a must have item. I prefer a daisy chain since it allows much more adjustment in where and how you attach your pack. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which is not difficult in these canyons. I strongly suggest a long sleeve shirt and long pants for this slot or you will leave a bunch a skin on the canyon walls. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Turkey Knob\" are essential. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/leprechaun.htm 1/25/2018 Leprechaun Canyon - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 or you could encounter major difficulties. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. Check the local weather report before committing. Warning: Large frame canyoneers will have extreme difficulty descending the Middle and Left Forks of this canyon. My chest measurement is 43\" around. There are sections of this canyon that I found severely difficult to squeeze through. If you have any question about your abilities to squeeze through some of the narrow slots it would be in your best interest to do the hike to Leprechaun Junction and look at one of the difficult slots you will encounter on your descent. You have been warned! Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 28 miles. At mile marker 28.0 there is a short spur road on the left (east) side of the road. The spur road leads back about 100 yards to a stand of trees. This is the trailhead. There are several nice primitive campsites in the area. The most popular campsite with the canyoneering community is often referred to as the Sandthrax Campground and is located at Mile Marker 28.3 midway between the trailhead to Leprechaun Canyon and Sandthrax Canyon. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38 01' 03\", W110 32' 15\"), hike northeast up the bottom of the wash, bushwhacking through the willows and tamarisk bushes where required. After 15 minutes (0.6 miles) of hiking you will encounter a major drainage entering from the left (north) side (N38 01' 30\", W110 31' 59\"). The route climbs up the nose of the buttress between the main canyon and the side drainage. Continue route finding your way as required, there is no climbing involved if you carefully choose your route up the ridge. You might encounter an interesting survey marker (N38 01' 49\", W110 31' 48\"), which was placed in 1922 if you keep your eyes peeled. From near the survey marker the upper bowl of Leprechaun Canyon should soon become clearly visible. You should be able to see three distinct slots, which are referred to as Right Fork (aka: East Fork), Middle Fork and Left Fork (aka: West Fork). I highly advise that you do the Right Fork of Leprechaun before attempting the Left Fork or the more hazardous Middle Fork. The easiest method of accessing the drop in point of your chosen slot is to keep hiking up the ridge you are climbing until reaching the relatively flat cap above the canyons, and than contouring over to the head of the intended slot. Be extremely careful that you are dropping into the correct drainage. More than one rescue has resulted from a navigational error. The cap can be confusing and all the canyons look similar from the top. Right Fork (Upper Leprechaun): The Right Fork (aka: East Fork) is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. Total descent time is 4 to 5 hours car to car. The Right Fork is my favorite of the three forks and is the best choice if you have little or no experience with a Mae West Slot. I advocate that you do the Right Fork first so you will have a good understanding of the other forks before entering. Hike out on the ridge separating Middle Fork and Right Fork until you notice a scrambling route down a loose slope to the bottom of Right Fork. The route is easy to locate from the ridge. From the canyon bottom (N38 02' 01\", W110 31' 19\") you can climb the short distance up canyon through and interesting slot section to the dryfall near the headwall. Next you want to turn around and head down canyon. This canyon is extremely narrow in places and will require gentle stemming above the canyon bottom to by-pass several very mild \"Mae West\" sections. You will also probably encounter a couple of short knee to waist deep wading sections mixed in with some fun downclimbing. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/leprechaun.htm 1/25/2018 Leprechaun Canyon - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 There is only one mandatory rappel and it is located just before you reach Leprechaun Junction, which is where the Right Fork joins the Middle and Left Fork. The rappel is 30-feet. But before you commit to the rappel you might want to enjoy a dinosaur trackway (N38 01' 46\", W110 31' 40\"). To locate the dinosaur trackway you must backtrack 75 yards up canyon to the obvious gray mudstone layer of rock in the bottom of the canyon.The tracks are located in the gray mudstone and are hard to see because they have been eroded to a high degree. The site consists of about 6 or 7 large three-toed tracks probably belonging to an Allosaurus, which was the most common carnivore during the period in which this trackway was formed. Fossil footprints are a rare, non-renewable resource. Please help preserve and protect them. Don't let the fact that there is only one rappel fool you, this is not a simple canyon. Middle Fork (Shimrock): Middle Fork is rated 3A R III using the Canyon Rating System. Total descent time is 5 to 6 hours car to car. A headlamp is required to complete this canyon. Middle Fork is the most difficult and committing of the three forks. The Middle Fork is not recommenced for beginners. The drop-in point for Middle Fork (N38 02' 09\", W110 31' 26\") is a 35 foot rappel into the narrow canyon bottom. There are actually two fingers that provide different options for dropping into this section of canyon. It doesn't matter which finger you use since the entrance rappel is about the same and both fingers join up 200 yards down canyon. Pick your poison. The center section of this canyon contains long sections of very narrow Mae West slots. Navigating this canyon is very physical and time consuming. The drop-in point is the only rappel required in this canyon. Near the bottom of the canyon, after the junction of Middle and Left Fork there is a very deep and narrow slot that is referred to as Belfast Boulevard. A headlamp is required for this section because it is remarkably dark. There are sections in Belfast Boulevard where you must crawl under chokestones. After Belfast Boulevard the canyon joins up with the Right Fork at Leprechaun Junction. There is an escape route up the nose of the buttress between Middle and Left Fork if climbing through Belfast Boulevard does not appeal to you. If you have completed the upper section of Middle Fork you have already been through tighter places. The big difference is this squeeze is really dark. Left Fork (Shamrock): Left Fork (aka: West Fork) is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total descent time is 3 to 4 hours car to car. A headlamp is required to complete his option. Left Fork splits into two fingers near its head. To enter the canyon you must route find your way down the ridge between the two fingers. Hike up both fingers if you wish to explore. The drop-in point for Left Fork (N38 02' 07\", W110 31' 44\") is where the two fingers join and consists of a 50 foot rappel into the narrow canyon bottom. The drop-in point for Left Fork has no obvious natural anchors. The natural anchor method we use at this rappel is to dig a deep hole in the sandy bottom of a nearby pothole. Next we locate a large rock, tie webbing round the rock and toss it in the hole and cover it with sand. This method works great. The Left Fork contains four short rappels or difficult downclimbs depending upon your skill level. Near the bottom of the canyon, after the junction of Middle and Left Fork there is a very deep and narrow slot, which is referred to as Belfast Boulevard. A headlamp is required for this section because it is remarkably dark. There are sections in Belfast Boulevard where you must crawl under chokestones. After Belfast Boulevard the canyon joins up with the Right Fork at Leprechaun Junction. There is an escape route up the nose of the buttress between Middle and Left Fork if climbing through Belfast Boulevard does not appeal to you. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/leprechaun.htm 1/25/2018 Leprechaun Canyon - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 4 of 4 Leprechaun Junction: Leprechaun Junction (N38 01' 45\", W110 31' 44\") is where Right, Middle and Left Fork join together. This is also the point where most hikers from the bottom are forced to turn around. The Hike from Leprechaun Junction back to the trailhead is one mile and involves a nice stroll through a deep narrow slot, a very exciting and large subway section and finishes with some swirling kiddy narrows. Photographers will find the section of canyon between Leprechaun Junction and the trailhead to be very photogenic. Hiking Notes: If you are not into technical canyoneering but would enjoy visiting a fun, photographic slot canyon this is the place. From the trailhead hike northeast up the bottom of the wash, bushwhacking through the willows and tamarisk bushes where required. After 15 to 20 minutes (0.6 miles) of hiking you will encounter a major drainage entering from the left (north) side. Stay in the main wash bottom (to the right) and continue hiking up the canyon. There is no more bushwhacking from this point on. Your first surprise will be a short section of kiddy narrows. There is often water in this section of kiddy narrows, which will require knee deep wading. Next you will encounter a deep, beautiful subway section of narrows. The last surprise is a deep, dark, narrow slot that leads to the more open Leprechaun Junction. Hikers cannot continue beyond this point. A round trip hike to Leprechaun Junction is 2 miles and will require between 1 to 2 hours, depending on your speed and how much exploring you do.

Well Lucky Charms should get you going. This is more of a short and fun route than a big canyoneering adventure. The route does visit several short sections of sandstone narrows and several beautifully fluted dryfalls, but the charm is really in the squeezing, scrambling and climbing involved in completing the circuit. I have added this route for those visiting the Irish Canyons (North Wash Canyons) who might find a little spare time in their busy schedule. Perhaps before breakfast? General Information: This route should require approximately one hour to complete so take a big drink of water and leave everything else in your vehicle. You will enjoy this route much more if you travel light. Those completing this route should have the ability to lead a 5.6 to 5.7 climb. The route has several fun sections of climbing with a fall potential of up to 25 feet. Beginners and youngsters will require a competent leader and a 60' rope for handlines and belays. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Turkey Knob\" are essential. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. This canyon has a minor flash flood danger. Check the local weather report before committing. Lucky Charms is rated 2A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 to mile marker 27.0. This is the trailhead. There is nothing to mark the location except for a culvert passing under the road a little to the south. There is no turn-off in the area but there is plenty of room to pull safely off to the side of the road. There are several nice primitive campsites in the area. The most popular campsite with the canyoneering community is often referred to as the Sandthrax Campground and is located at Mile Marker 28.3 midway between the trailhead to Leprechaun Canyon and Sandthrax Canyon. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38° 01' 13\", W110° 33' 17\") follow the main wash as it snakes back into the sandstone cliffs. In a very short distance the canyon will slot up and begin to present you with several small challenges. The first major obstacle is a nicely fluted dryfall about 30 feet high. You can attempt to climb the dryfall or backtrack 25 yards and exit to the left (LUC) by climbing up the slickrock to a bench at the same level as the dryfall. Continue up canyon until you encounter a wonderfully fluted dryfall at the head of the canyon. This is the most difficult obstacle you will encounter. You must climb the dryfall and exit the top of the canyon (N38° 01' 31\", W110° 33' 23\"). The traction on the sandstone is outstanding so do not be intimidated; the climb is easier than it looks. After exiting the head of the canyon you must hike west for 1/4 mile until you encounter a major wash. Follow this wash downstream until it pours over a 200 foot high dryfall into a deep canyon (N38° 01' 35\", W110° 33' 38\"). Do not attempt to downclimb this dryfall. Instead, circle http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/luckycharms.htm 1/25/2018 Lucky Charms - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 around the north side of the canyon and rim walk 150 yards down canyon until you encounter a small, steep, pothole filled side canyon (N38° 01' 34\", W110° 33' 46\"). This is the route to the canyon bottom. Friction down the steep side canyon from pothole to pothole until you reach the canyon bottom. At several potholes you will find the going easier if you exit out the pothole to the right (LDC) onto the slickrock and downclimb into the next pothole. It looks steep and scary but the slickrock provides great traction. At the canyon bottom you might want to hike up and look at the 200 foot dryfall from the bottom before hiking down canyon to the highway (N38° 01' 21\", W110° 33' 43\"). From the highway just hike 1/4 mile south back to your vehicle. By this time everyone else in your camp should be awake and you can bore them to death with details of your supreme climbing skills over breakfast.

This canyon combines perfectly with other slot canyons located in the North Wash area to create a great day of Colorado Plateau style canyoneering. General Information: Merry Piglet Canyon is a short slot canyon that requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 2 hours. Merry Piglet is rated 3A I using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. Under normal conditions you will encounter knee to waist deep wading with the possibility of swimming. Wetsuits are normal only used in cold weather. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A 120-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which is not difficult in this canyon and should be considered as part of the fun. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Hite North\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Merry Piglet Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a minor flash flood danger. Check the local weather before committing. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 33 miles to mile marker 33.6. This is the Merry Piglet Canyon Trailhead. For those familiar with the area the trailhead is 1/2 mile south of the Hog Springs Picnic Area. The canyon is identified as a boulder filled gulley entering from the east. Pull to the side of the road and park where convenient. The shoulder of the road is wide in this area and it's easy to pull off the road and park. This trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: From the Merry Piglet Canyon Trailhead (N37° 57' 37\", W110° 29' 02\"), hike east up the boulder filled gulley until your reach a dryfall (N37° 57' 40\", W110° 29' 00\"). Bypass the dryfall on the south (right) side climbing a short 12-foot wall (YDS 5.6). The wall is the crux of the route and should be easily climbable by most. Once you have someone on top of the dryfall a handline can be lowered from the top making it easy for those following. From the top of the dryfall cross Merry Piglet to the north (left) and scramble up a small rock filled ravine until you can exit to the west (left) out onto the slickrock. Once on the slickrock hike up until you reach the white sandstone layer that forms a ledge. Follow the white sandstone ledge east (right) and hike to the top of Merry Piglet (N37° 57' 54\", W110° 28' 51\"). From the top of Merry Piglet head downstream, your first rappel will be 20-feet and anchored from a tree. This rappel might deposit you in water if there have been recent rains. The http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/merrypiglet.htm 1/25/2018 Merry Piglet - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 first rappel is followed by a downclimb that ends in what is often a waist deep pool. Those with intermediate or better climbing skills can often bypass this pothole by climbing around it to the south (left) side, everyone else is going wading. The next section of canyon is followed by three 50-foot rappels in rapid-fire succession. You might encounter a deep pool of water at the bottom of this sequence of rappels, or it could be dry, it just depends on recent conditions. Continue downstream and you will soon encounter the dryfall you climbed to begin the route. Rappel, handline or downclimb, it's up to you. Just remember that mediocre medical care is at least 3 hours away. Hike back to the trailhead. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

It is not a destination canyon, but makes for an interesting diversion if you have a couple of hours to spare while visiting the area. General Information: Messin' Around is a technical canyoneering located in the North Wash area that requires complete technical gear. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 to 4 hours. Messin' Around is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. In normal conditions this canyon is dry, no wet suit is required. There are at least two tricky downclimbs/rappels in this canyon. The longest downclimb/rappel is 30-feet and a 60-foot rope is required. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Stair Canyon\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate, but make certain you are dropping into the correct drainage. All waypoints and maps for Messin' Around use the WGS84 datum. This route has a minor flash flood danger. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which is not difficult in these canyons. Trailhead Information: A high clearance vehicle is advised for accessing this trailhead, four-wheel-drive is not required. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 25 miles. At mile marker 25.5 (N38° 02' 01\", W110° 34' 30\") there is a well maintained dirt road on the east side of the highway. Turn east on the dirt road and follow it for 6.0 miles to a major three-way intersection (N38° 04' 20\", W110° 29' 44\"). Take the east (right) fork and drive 2.2 miles to a major three- way intersection (N38° 04' 17\", W110° 27' 47\"). Turn south (right) and follow the road for 0.8 miles to the Messin' Around Trailhead. Route Information: From the Messin' Around Trailhead (N38° 03' 40\", W110° 28' 10\"), hike south-southwest. Soon you will encounter a shallow wash leading in the same direction, keep following the shallow wash and it will lead you to the start of Messin' Around (N38° 03' 06\", W110° 28' 37). It is 3/4 mile from the trailhead to the start of Messin' Around. From the head of the canyon hike downstream and let the fun begin. There are two long tricky downclimbs located within the canyon, which will be rappels for the less skilled. The first downclimb/rappel is 20-feet. This is followed by the second downclimb/rappel that consists of an intimidating 30-foot downward flaring chimney with a blind start. At the second rappel http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/messinaround.htm 1/25/2018 Messin' Around - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 everyone in you group should rappel from your best climber, then spot the last person from below. Rigging a rappel for the 30-foot chimney might prove difficult. After the downclimbs/rappels continue downstream noting a large crumbly slope on the west (right) side of the canyon. This is the exit (N38° 03' 00\", W110° 28' 43\"), and is the recommended option. From the exit continue downstream to the Final Drop (N38° 02' 52\", W110° 28' 33\") and enjoy the view. Retreat upstream to the exit, and back to the trailhead. Optional Final Drop: If you plan to complete the Final Drop and hike out Butler Canyon the following information will prove useful. The Final Drop is 90-feet high and requires a 60-meter (195-foot) rope. The rappel is free-hanging and deposits you directly into the trees. Enjoy the long hike down Butler Canyon to North Wash.

This canyon combines perfectly with other slot canyons located in the North Wash area to create a great day of Colorado Plateau style canyoneering. General Information: Morocco Canyon is a short slot canyon that requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 2 hours. Morocco is rated 3A I using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. Under normal conditions you will encounter knee to waist deep wading with the possibility of swimming. Wetsuits are normal only used in cold weather. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A 100-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required.

Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Hite North\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Morocco Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a minor flash flood danger. Check the local weather before committing. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 32 miles to mile marker 32.3. This is the Morocco Canyon Trailhead. The trailhead is identified by a large culvert crossing under Highway 95. Pull to the south side of the culvert and park off the highway. The shoulder of the road is wide in this area and it's easy to pull off the road and park. This trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: From the Morocco Canyon Trailhead (N37° 58' 37\", W110° 29' 30\"), you will want to look directly east and study your approach before you start hiking. From the trailhead you will see a lone cedar tree at the base of the slickrock. This is where you will gain access through the bottom cliff band. Once on top of the first cliff band hike up the slickrock to where the Wingate sandstone meets the vertical Navajo sandstone. At the base of the Navajo sandstone you will find a nearly flat ledge system. This ledge system is the key to the route. One you have reached the ledge system just follow it south, around the corner and to the head of Morocco Canyon (N37° 58' 29\", W110° 29' 13\"). The first rappel is into a narrow slot located right at the head of Morocco. The rappel is 45-feet and is anchored from a large rock cairn. This is the longest rappel in this canyon. Just below the first rappel is a pothole that is chest deep when filled with water. Mediocre climbers can cross the pothole without getting wet. Poor climbers might be forced through the pothole which nearly always contains water. Just past the pothole the watercourse has created a beautiful arch that is considered the scenic highlight of the canyon. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/morocco.htm 1/25/2018 Morocco Canyon - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 Shortly after the arch you will encounter the second rappel. This rappel is anchored from a large chokestone at shoulder lever and is 35-feet high. From the top this rappel looks much longer than it actually is, because from the top you can't see the large ledge you will actually be landing on. Enjoy the hike downstream until you encounter the third rappel. This is a very short rappel of 15-feet that is anchored from a large chokestone. This rappel can be downclimbed by the skilled, all others will want to rappel or at least set up a handline as the downclimb is very awkward. Below the third rappel you will probably encounter several pools of water. There are three ways to deal with the water. The first and easiest is to splash through the middle, The second method is to bypass the pools by climbing around the pools on the north (right) side using a ledge system that traverses above the pools. The third method is to stem and bridge over the pools. Pick your poison. Below the pools you will find the fourth rappel. This rappel is 20-feet high, anchored from a rock cairn, and it deposits you in a pothole that is normally less than waist deep. The fifth rappel follows almost immediately, is anchored from a chokestone, and is 20-feet high. This rappel can be downclimbed by the highly skilled. The fifth rappel is soon followed by a short pool that can be anywhere from non-existent to a swimmer, it just depends on recent conditions. After the pool the canyon widens out before reaching the sixth rappel. The sixth rappel is 30-feet high, and is anchored from a rock cairn. From the base of the sixth rappel it's a short scramble to reach highway 95 (N37° 58' 23\", W110° 29' 30\"). Once on the highway it's a short 1/4 mile walk north, back to the trailhead.

I am providing a route description because the location and history of the canyon are well known and some canyoneers just can't resist a major challenge. If you are not familiar with the canyon's history I suggest you read the story Sandthrax - Chasm of Doom. Entering this canyon carries the high probability of serious injury or death. Warning: If you attempt this canyon, every member of your group must be a highly skilled canyoneer and rock climber. This canyon is deadly for beginners. Sandthrax Canyon is NOT suitable for the general canyoneering public and is rated 4B X III using the Canyon Rating System. Errors in technique or judgment will likely result in serious injury or death. Do not underestimate the difficulty and danger of descending this canyon. A rescue in this canyon would be hazardous and extremely troublesome. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. Now that I have scared you with the warnings of death here is the deal. This canyon really kicked our ass the first time. It was also the first exceptionally difficult canyon that we had ever done. We attempted the canyon alpine style with no outside support and were lucky to escape intact. This canyon has experienced very few descents since our first attempt, some groups have done the route with few problems and some groups have had their ass handed to them. Make sure someone knows where you are going and when you expect to return. General Information: Sandthrax Canyon is an extreme technical canyoneering challenge. The technical portion of the canyon consists of climbing, wading, rappelling and downclimbing. There is almost no hiking involved with this route. You will be stemming nearly the entire canyon. At least one climber with the ability to lead 5.10 routes is required, all members of the group must be able to lead 5.8 routes. I highly recommend that anyone entering this canyon supply a competent technical support team to provide assistance from the upper canyon rim if required. The support team should consist of at least two experienced members and be equipped with 600 feet of rope, jumars and communication gear. Local search and rescue is not equipped or trained in rescues of the type that Sandthrax would require. Sandthrax Canyon requires complete technical gear. A 100-foot climbing (dynamic) rope is recommended as the longest rappel is 40-feet. The dynamic rope will allow you to belay for safety in several sections. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, several double length slings and 100 feet of webbing. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon. The canyon requires advance natural anchor building skills to descend. The sandstone in Sandthrax is the consistency of brown sugar and placing bolted anchors is risky. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sandthrax.htm 1/25/2018 Sandthrax Canyon - North Wash - Technical Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 In addition to your standard technical gear the following items are recommended for defeating the crux of the route. Two #5 camlots, two #6 camlots and one #4 Big Bro. This should allow you to climb or aid the crux. This is a minimum suggested rack. If you cannot do the climbing required you are in big trouble. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Turkey Knob\" are helpful. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. This canyon contains extremely long sections of \"mae west\", that require good climbing skills over long periods of time without rest. This is an extremely physical canyon requiring constant downclimbing, wading, climbing, stemming and chimneying. In normal conditions the canyon contains no swimming. The smaller and lighter your pack the better. Where Did The Canyon Get It's Name: It's important to know the events of our first attempted descent occurred one month after the 9/11 terrorist hijackings and the big congress mail room anthrax scare. The entire country was putting on a brave face but in reality everyone was hunkered down just waiting for the next attack. When we were trapped in Sandthrax I had one of those cheap disposable point and shoot cameras in my pack. After the ordeal I took the camera into a local grocery store with a one hour photo service to get the film developed. After dropping off the camera at the one hour photo service I proceed to do some grocery shopping while the film is being develop. When the female film technician pops open the back of the camera sand spills out everywhere. The film technician freaks out and reports she has just been poisoned with anthrax. The cops who happen to have a sub-station next to this particular grocery store and who have been watching way too much TV spring into action....... Next thing I know I'm face down in the isle of the grocery store with two cops standing on top of me with their guns drawn. After I told my partner Hank Moon the story and he stopped rolling on the floor laughing he suggested we name the canyon Sandthrax, in honor of my grocery shopping episode. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 29 miles. At mile marker 28.4 there is a pull-out on the left (east) side of the road. This is the trailhead. There are several nice primitive campsites in the area. The most popular campsite with the canyoneering community is often referred to as the Sandthrax Campground and is located at Mile Marker 28.3 midway between the trailheads of Leprechaun Canyon and Sandthrax Canyon. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38° 00' 52\", W110° 31' 47\"), hike up the north side of the short slot canyon. The route up is easy with moderate route finding over slickrock. As you hike up there are several opportunities to look into the very deep and narrow slot of which the bottom is not visible. The first rappel is at the head of the canyon (N38° 01' 21\", W110° 31' 13\") and is 40-feet using a bush to provide a natural anchor. The first section of narrows is pretty with big swirling sculptured sandstone formations. There are many difficult and dangerous sections where you will have the opportunity to injure yourself in this canyon. The canyon is not very pretty for a slot canyon. The canyon contains extreme mae west sections. You will often find yourself chimneying unprotected 50 to 70 feet above the canyon floor for long sections and downclimbing tight narrows. The canyon contains two \"Devil Pit's\" and several \"Bomb Bay's\". There are various places where 5.10 off- width crack climbing skills are required to get above a mae west slot. Only the most highly http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/sandthrax.htm 1/25/2018 Sandthrax Canyon - North Wash - Technical Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 skilled canyoneers will be able to complete this canyon, all others will need to be fished out by there support crew. Your life might depend on your support crew so if you enter this canyon choose your support crew well. A support crew can probably operate most effectively from the north canyon rim.

If you were to become wedged in the slot rescue would be remarkably difficult and death is a possibility. The extreme narrows section is time consuming, physically exhausting, and psychologically exacting. The extreme narrows are also stunningly beautiful and absurdly haunting. General Information: Shenanigans is a technical canyoneering adventure best left to munchkin sized canyoneers. The route involves some extremely tight narrows. An exit is provided for all large framed canyoneers who want to visit the upper portion of this slot canyon. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 5 to 6 hours. Shenanigans requires complete technical gear and the smallest pack possible. Shenanigans is rated 3B III R using the Canyon Rating System. In normal conditions the route might contain a couple short sections of waist deep wading. No wet suit is required. There are at least two required rappels in this canyon and probably more depending upon your downclimbing skills. The highest rappel is 50-feet and a 100-foot rope is required. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Stair Canyon\" and \"Turkey Knob\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Shenanigans use the WGS84 datum. This route has a minor flash flood danger. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which is not difficult in these canyons. Warning: Large frame canyoneers will not fit through the last section of Shenanigans. If you can not squeeze through an opening 10\" wide you will not fit through the final section of this canyon. You can not climb up and over the constrictions in the slot as you can in most other mae west type canyons. An escape is provided before the final narrows. I highly suggest all large frame canyoneers use the escape. Becoming wedged inside this canyon could be a life threatening situation. You have been warned! Current wisdom is if you can not fit through the Middle Fork of Leprechaun Canyon (Shimrock) at ground level you will not fit through Shenanigans as it is a little narrower. Some canyoneers set the upper safe weight limit for the final section of narrows at 180 pounds. I have never considered weight to be a good indicator, but I pass the information along for your use. No matter your size, the final narrow passage will be slow, physically, and psychologically demanding. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/shenanigans.htm 1/25/2018 Shenanigans - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 25 miles. At mile marker 25.5 there is a well maintained dirt road on the east side of the highway. Turn east on the dirt road and follow it for 3.9 miles to a major three-way intersection guarded by a large tree. This is the Optional Lower Trailhead. If you have a shuttle vehicle leave it here and you will eliminate an extra mile of hiking at the end of the day. From the Optional Lower Trailhead follow the main road east for 0.9 miles. Find a place to pull off the road and park. This is the Shenanigans Trailhead. Usually any carefully driven passenger vehicle can access this trailhead in good weather conditions. Route Information: From the Shenanigans Trailhead (N38° 03' 26\", W110° 30' 21\"), hike northeast for 1 mile to the head of Shenanigans (N38° 03' 39\", W110° 29' 19\"). From the head of the canyon route find your way down through a break in the slickrock. You will be stopped almost immediately by a 7-foot dryfall. A small tree will allow for a handline down an awkward overhang. Continue downstream 100-feet and you will reach a 35-foot rappel down a dryfall. Head downstream and enjoy the action. There is a lot of downclimbing, stemming, and hiking with an occasional pool if it has rained recently. After a few hours you will reach the slanted hallway that is dark, right leaning, and physical. There are a few chokestones you will have to climb over in the dark confines of the slot while shuffling sideways. Once out of the dark hallway, you can see the sky but there is more tight stuff to contend with before the canyon opens up at the Last Chance Exit (N38° 03' 01\" W110° 29' 46\"). The Last Chance Exit is located on the east (left) side of the canyon and is noted by a visible rock slide extending to the rim. If you are a large frame canyoneer this is where you exit! For munchkin sized canyoneers the Last Chance Exit is a nice place to grab a snack and get ready for the business. If you decide to continue downstream the canyon floor drops away immediately and the squeezing and downclimbing continues. Soon you will reach the Grim Crawl. You can rappel all members of your party down this section of canyon using a human anchor. The final member of your party must make the Grim Crawl and then downclimb to the canyon floor. Removing your pack before making the crawl will allow you to stay low and away from the drop. Be careful on the downclimb to the canyon floor, it is sandy and wide. Once your party has completed the Grim Crawl head down canyon and enjoy some incredible narrows. Soon you will reach a natural bridge. Shortly after the natural bridge the canyon gets extremely tight for approximately 100-yards. The canyon is 10 to 12 inches wide for approximately 50 off the deck. After the extreme squeeze the canyon widens a bit and you climb up on a fallen rock. From the top of the fallen rock you can either stem up high or downclimb and experience more extreme squeezing similar in tightness to the previous section. If going high you will need to stem for approximately 60-feet and than downclimb and squeeze your way to the exit of the canyon. The canyon exit looks as if a meat cleaver chopped the sandstone. The two-stage exit consists of two 50-foot rappels. The first rappel is anchored by a large rock horn at top. Please place a sling around the rock horn to minimize rope grooves. The second rappel is anchored from webbing around a chokestone. The final rappel is into a spring fed pool of water. It is possible to avoid the pool by traversing east (left) along thin slippery ledges to where the pool is only knee deep. The pool of water completes the technical section of canyon. Pack your gear and begin hiking downstream. 1/4 mile below the pool a large canyon enters from the west (right). 200-yards after this side canyon a large arch is visible high on the west (right) canyon wall. 1/4 mile below the arch a second large canyon enters from the east (left). 1/4 mile below this second side canyon the Exit Canyon (N38° 02' 05\" W110° 30' 34\") is noticeable on the west (right) side. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/shenanigans.htm 1/25/2018 Shenanigans - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 At first the Exit Canyon looks impossible to ascend, but it does allow access to the rim. Climb up the Exit Canyon and be careful of loose rocks. Several places in the Exit Canyon require 4th class climbing over sandy rotten rock. After the last exposed climbing section traverse right on ledges and follow cairns to the top. Currently there is a large 4-foot cairn that is hard to miss which marks the canyon rim. Once at the cairn, route find cross-country in a north- northeast direction to the Optional Lower Trailhead. (N38° 02' 54\" W110° 31' 04\"). If you did not set up an optional shuttle you still have a 1 mile hike up the road to reach your vehicle.

The Shillelagh was originally used to teach the Irish sword fighting when they were not permitted to use swords. In modern times a Shillelagh is often used as a walking stick and is occasionally referred to as a snake stick. Shillelagh Canyon is a fun and a technically challenging adventure. The beauty of this canyon is impressive; the narrows are deep, tight, dramatic and entertaining. General Information: Shillelagh Canyon offers its enchantment with only a short approach hike. The canyon has two technical sections, which are divided into the Right Fork and Left Fork. I recommend a group size of 6 or less. Hikers can enjoy the bottom portion of Shillelagh Canyon. It is easy to hike up the canyon bottom and enjoy long stretches of narrows. There are good primitive campsites in the area of the trailhead. Shillelagh Canyon requires complete technical gear. There is possible wading but no swimming required in normal conditions. The canyon should be easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Two 50-meter ropes (Note: The Left Fork can be done with one 60 meter rope), several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate natural anchors, which is not difficult in this canyon. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Turkey Knob\" are essential. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. Check the local weather report before committing. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 27 miles. At mile marker 27.4 there is a culvert under the road next to a small turnout. This is the trailhead (N38° 01' 15\", W110° 32' 53\"). There are several nice primitive campsites in the area. The most popular campsite with the canyoneering community is often referred to as the Sandthrax Campground and is located at Mile Marker 28.3 midway between the trailhead to Leprechaun Canyon and Sandthrax Canyon. Route Information: From the trailhead, hike east on Highway 95 for 0.2 miles to mile marker 27.6 and a culvert under the road. This is also the trailhead to Blarney Canyon (N38° 01' 13\", W110° 32' 41\"). The route climbs up the ridge between Shillelagh and Blarney Canyon. There is no trail http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/shillelagh.htm 1/25/2018 Shillelagh Canyon - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 and moderate route finding is required. There is no climbing involved if you carefully choose your route up the ridge. The easiest method of reaching the drop in point of your intended slot is to keep hiking up the ridge between Shillelagh and Blarney Canyon until reaching the relatively flat cap above the canyons. Once you reach the cap it is easy to hike cross-country to your intended destination. Be extremely careful that you are dropping into the correct drainage. At least one rescue has resulted from a navigational error. The cap can be confusing and all the canyons look similar from the top. Right (East) Fork: The Right Fork is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total descent time is approximately 3 hours car to car. The drop-in point for the Right Fork is where the slot reaches the cap and forms an easy walk down (N38° 01' 59\", W110° 32' 30\"). Drop into the wash and begin hiking down canyon, the wash begins to deepen quickly. The only major obstacle is a big, two stage, rappel into the deep slot (N38° 01' 54\", W110° 32' 36\"). The first rappel is 60 feet to a large flat bench. Don't worry about room, the bench is 50- feet wide. The second rappel is 125 feet to the canyon floor. At the second rappel use the rocks to the left (LDC) of the dryfall for an anchor to avoid a deep, water filled pothole. Stash your ropes and enjoy the best part of the canyon. There is scrambling and downclimbing but nothing very difficult for the remaining hike out. Left (West) Fork: The Left Fork is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total descent time is approximately 3 hours car to car. The drop-in point for the Left Fork is where the slot reaches the cap and forms an easy walk down (N38° 02' 02\", W110° 32' 55\"). Drop into the wash and begin hiking down canyon, the wash begins to deepen quickly and there is a short section of kiddie narrows to enjoy. The major obstacle is a large two stage rappel at the canyon headwall (N38° 01' 56\", W110° 33' 02\"). The first rappel is 40 feet to a large flat bench. Don't worry about room, the bench is 40-feet wide. The second rappel is 90 feet to the canyon floor. From the canyon floor it is an enjoyable slot with scrambling, downclimbing and fun with nothing very difficult for the remaining hike out.

The canyon requires no rappelling, but forces all canyoneers up off the ground for extended periods of time. Upper Stair features two separate sections of what is known as a \"Mae West Slot\", which is a slot so narrow that it is impossible to pass through. This feature forces you to climb up and over the obstacle. Upper Stair ends with an engaging slickrock hike back to the rim of the canyon that requires some moderate climbing and route finding. The canyon offers its experience with only a short approach hike. Any descent of this canyon requires intermediate or better rock climbing skills. Warning: Upper Stair is rated 3A R II using the Canyon Rating System. Every member of your group must be a skilled canyoneer. This canyon could be deadly for beginners, even with advanced leadership. The following description is not a substitute for commonsense and experience. Do not underestimate the difficulty of descending this canyon. To safely descend this canyon every member of your group must be able to climb at a level of 5.7 or above. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. A rescue in this canyon would be dangerous and extremely difficult. General Information: Upper Stair is an astounding technical canyoneering adventure and a good intermediate introduction to Mae West canyons and stemming. Moderate rock climbing skills are required. The only technical gear required for Upper Stair is a climbing harness and a \"bunny strap\". A bunny strap is a length of webbing or a daisy chain with a carabiner attached which will allow you to hang your pack from your harness while you chimney, climb and stem above and through the narrow slots. A bunny strap is a must have item. I prefer a daisy chain since it allows much more adjustment in where and how you attach your pack. A helmet, small pack with water and food, and appropriate attire (long sleeve shirts and pants or elbow and knee pads) to protect your skin are also recommended. A belay device and a small piece of rope could be used for belays in a pinch. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 4 to 5 hours. This is a physical canyon requiring constant downclimbing, climbing, stemming and chimneying. This canyon is usually dry with perhaps some knee deep wading in normal conditions. This canyon is easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Bring as small and light of pack as possible. This canyon has no rappels, but is not recommended for inexperienced canyoneers since it does require some short upclimbs and extended periods of Mae West stemming. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Stair Canyon\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for Upper Stair Canyon use the WGS84 datum. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. Trailhead Information: This route does not require a shuttle vehicle. A 4-wheel drive vehicle is advised for accessing this trailhead, four-wheel-drive is not required, but those without 4-wheel drive will http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/upperstair.htm 1/25/2018 Upper Stair - North Wash - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 need to hike the final 2.2 miles to the actual trailhead. Lack of a 4-wheel drive will add approximately 45 minutes to your route time. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 25 miles. At mile marker 25.5 there is a well maintained dirt road on the east side of the highway. Turn east on the dirt road and follow it for 3.9 miles to a major three-way intersection guarded by a large tree. Turn left at the three way intersection and go north 4.2 miles where you will intersect a road coming in on the left (north). Take the sharp left on this road and drive 2.2 miles until you reach another junction. Turn right at this junction (N38°03' 52\", W110° 25' 48\") and drive another 0.3 miles to the Upper Stair Canyon Trailhead. There is no formal pull-out, so find a spot where you can pull off the road. The road for the last 2.2 miles is for 4-wheel drive vehicles only. There are washed out sections and areas with deep sand that would not be passable with low clearance or vehicles without 4 wheel drive. Route Information: From the Upper Stair Trailhead (N38°03' 42\", W110° 26' 02\") hike cross-country in a southeast direction for 150-yards to the upper rim of Stair Canyon. From the canyon rim route find you way down through several small cliff bands to the canyon bottom (N38°03' 29\", W110° 26' 00\"). After reaching the bottom of Upper Stair put on your harness and any padding and head downstream. The top of the canyon starts with a short tight section with a few minor obstacles as you begin your journey. After briefly touching back down, you will soon begin the first longer Mae West section (N38°03' 27\", W110° 26' 03\"). The slot is slanting to the south in this section. Find a good canyon width to traverse through and when in doubt, stay high. This Mae West section will require moderate to high stemming for most of its length and will require approximately 30 minutes to an hour to complete. After completing the first Mae West section, you will walk a short distance in an open area (N38°03' 20\", W110° 26' 09\"), and then you will encounter the second, longer Mae West section. This section is similar to the first, but a little longer and has parts that will require you to be a little bit higher off the ground. This Mae West section will require moderate to high stemming for most of its length and will require approximately 1 to 2 hours to complete. From the end of the second Mae West section, hike a few hundred yards down canyon to where there is a weakness on the north side of the canyon (N38° 03' 06\", W110° 26' 19\"). This is your exit. The exit requires a couple of slabby climbing moves (approximately 5.6 or 5.7) to get up the initial 15-foot section. After this you will want to continue up staying right of the obvious impassable north-facing cliff band that will be on your left side as you are ascending. Route find your way up the steep and exposed slickrock until you gain a flat bench just below the canyon rim cliff band. Once on the flat bench traverse to the north (right) bypassing two side canyons. You may need to go down a short distance to traverse these side canyons. Once past the side canyons, route find on the slickrock until you reach a weakness in the top cliff band (N38°03' 18\", W110° 26' 23\"). Climb through the weakness to the top of the cliff band and hike northwest until you intersect the 4x4 road (N38°03' 20.6\", W110° 26' 24\"). Once on the road, follow it north (right) for about 1/2 mile until you reach the trailhead.

For some strange reason canyoneers either really like it or don't care much for it. I'm not really sure why that is. I found the canyon to be a delightful way to spend half a day. General Information: Adobe Swale is a remarkable canyon with a number of drops that can be downclimbed or rappelled depending on your skills and desire. The canyon requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon contains knee to waist deep wading with no swimming required. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 4 to 5 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Baking Skillet Knoll\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Adobe Swale use the WGS84 datum. Adobe Swale is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The canyon contains two mandatory rappels. The longest rappel is 160 feet and requires two 50 meter ropes. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 75 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the numerous drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchors and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route but is helpful. If you set up a shuttle you will eliminate almost 2 miles of road walking. A mountain bike works excellent as a shuttle with this canyon. From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 15 miles to mile marker 15.7. At this point you will find a well-maintained dirt road on the east side of Highway 95. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Turn east onto the well-maintained dirt road and follow it for 4.3 miles to a fork in the road. Take the south (right) fork and drive an additional 1.4 miles. At this junction you will note an un-maintained 4x4 track heading south (right). If you wish to set up a vehicle or bicycle shuttle you must follow the 4x4 track 1.0 miles south to the Lower Trailhead. Then return to the junction and follow the main road northeast an additional 0.8 miles to the Upper Trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/adobe.htm 1/25/2018 Adobe Swale - Poison Spring - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 The Lower Trailhead is easy to recognize because it ends at the top of slickrock domes with a fantastic view for miles. This is also a descent place to camp if it's not windy. Passenger cars willing to take a beating can usually reach the Lower Trailhead. The Upper Trailhead is wherever you pull off the road and park. Any vehicle should be able to reach this trailhead in good weather conditions. Route Information: From the Upper Trailhead (N38° 09' 32\", W110° 31' 06\") hike east 1/3 mile to the edge of Adobe Swale (N38° 09' 30\", W110° 30' 42\"). Find a good place to downclimb into the canyon and let the fun begin. Hike down canyon and begin problem-solving the obstacles as they present themselves. The first big obstacle is a 30-foot chimney that can be downclimbed or rappelled. The biggest obstacle and most interesting section of canyon is a 160-foot rappel through a series of three potholes. The pothole conditions may range from dry to waist deep. Wetsuits should only be required in the coldest weather. The rappel is anchored from a deadman above. You must set this rappel up carefully so you can pull your ropes at the bottom. At the bottom of the three pothole rappel you must still execute a downclimb and a 45-foot rappel from a second deadman to where the canyon junctions with a small side drainage. From this junction just keep hiking down canyon. You will encounter a couple of more interesting problems that can be downclimbed or rappelled. You will eventually encounter a slanted hallway section that spits you out into a more open section of canyon. From this point on, just continue hiking down canyon until a large drainage and the first opportunity for escape opens up on the west (right) side of the canyon (N38° 07' 49\", W110° 31' 16\"). The side drainage will lead you back to the west rim of Adobe Swale, but you will have to snake and route find your way above several interesting alcoves. It's not difficult to exit but you do need to pay attention or you will be doing some backtracking. Once above the alcoves it's pretty easy to hike up slickrock to the Lower Trailhead (N38° 08' 13\", W110° 31' 35\"). If you spotted a shuttle vehicle you are done. If you didn't set up a shuttle you have a 2 mile road walk (or mountain bike ride) north to reach the Upper Trailhead. View Point Information: This canyoneering route offers a spectacular Viewpoint for the most awesome section of canyon. To reach the View Point Trailhead you must drive south from the Upper Trailhead, back down the main road, for 0.4 miles to a sharp bend in the road. This is the View Point Trailhead (N38° 09' 13\", W110° 31' 17\"). From the Viewpoint Trailhead hike east 1/4 mile to the rim of the canyon and a spectacular View Point (N38° 09' 11\", W110° 31' 05\"). You should have a great vantage point to view the 160-foot rappel through a series of three potholes.

Coyote cartoon. The views might be good but the action is even better. Arscenic is easy to access with only a short approach hike that is followed by a fun and entertaining canyoneering adventure through an exquisite Southern Utah slot canyon. The trek back to the trailhead visits a delightful little arch. General Information: Arscenic is a striking slot canyon with a sportsmanly amount of downclimbing. I strongly suggest wearing a long sleeve shirt and long pants for this slot unless you enjoy raspberries. This canyon can be a little hard on clothing; wear something you expect to thrash. Arscenic requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon contains knee to waist-deep wading with no swimming required. The canyon is accessible year-round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 4 to 5 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Turkey Knob\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Arscenic use the WGS84 datum. Arscenic is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger; check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The longest rappel in the canyon is 65 feet. The canyon can be completed with a single 60 meter rope if you carry it through the canyon with you. If you wish to use the simple and lightweight method mentioned in the route description you will need a 60-foot rope in addition to your 60 meter rope. If using the light weight method you will leave the 60 meter rope at the first rappel and retrieve it upon your return. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the dryfalls offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. This canyon currently contains one piton anchor that will be removed in the near future. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon; let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts, might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques? The problem-solving involved with using natural anchors and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: Any vehicle can access the trailhead during good weather. The area is crisscrossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From the Utah town of Hanksville, drive south on highway 95 for 20 miles to mile marker 20.3 (N38° 05' 50\", W110° 37' 17\"). At this point, a well-maintained gravel road crosses Highway 95. Turn east onto the well-maintained gravel road and follow it for 5.9 miles to a tee in http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/arscenic.htm 1/25/2018 Arscenic - Poison Spring - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 the road. You will know you are at the correct location if you passed a solar-powered pump 250 yards before reaching the tee. Passenger cars might wish to park at the tee to avoid the remaining road, which becomes rougher and sandy. At the tee turn north and follow the road 0.3 miles to the trailhead. You will know you are at the correct location when the road dips down into a shallow sandy wash with several trees. You can pull off the road next to the trees and park. This is the trailhead for Arscenic, Constrychnine and Slideanide Canyon. The trailhead is one of the better locations in the area to camp, which is not saying a whole lot. There does not seem to be an abundance of impressive campgrounds in the immediate area. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38° 05' 33\", W110° 31' 34\") hike north across the desert for 1/2 mile until you encounter a dryfall at the beginning of the Arscenic Drainage (N38° 05' 55\", W110° 31' 38\"). You can climb down this dryfall using a ledge system on the east (right). Continue downstream anther 1/4 mile passing a second dryfall on the west (left) until you reach a third dryfall that is deep and requires a rappel (N38° 06' 07\", W110° 31' 47\"). The third dryfall guards the entrance to the actual slot canyon. The dryfall is segmented into three sections of 50 feet, 35 feet and 65 feet. The first rappel is easy to sling from a large boulder mounted on the canyon rim, the second drop can be continued as part of the first rappel or downclimbed by the skilled. The third drop is the tricky one. You have two choices to rig this rappel. Option \"A\" involves using a long piece of webbing and slinging a chokestone wedged into the second section of the dryfall. Option \"B\" involves slinging a chokestone perched on the lip of the third section of dryfall that is difficult to begin the rappel from. Over time I am sure one of these anchors will become customary, but until that day you are on your own. Of course there is a very easy lightweight method to deal with the start of this canyon. Bring a 60 meter rope and anchor it at the top and then you don't have to deal with the segmented start or carrying a bunch of rope through the canyon with you. If you decide to use this method, you will only need to carry a 60-foot rope through the canyon to use in case of an emergency. The 60 meter rope is simple to retrieve on your return trek. Shortly after your reach the bottom of the segmented entrance rappel, you will encounter a 20-foot chimney that is downclimbed. You can protect this downclimb with a rope if you desire, but the downclimb is easier than it looks. From here until the end of the technical section, you will be downclimbing various drops and chimneys. Most are not difficult if you possess some climbing skills and you use a good partner-assist technique. Through this section you will likely encounter knee to waist-deep wading. The technical section is approximately 1/2 mile long and is time-consuming. From the end of the technical section keep hiking down canyon for approximately 1/2 mile until you reach a junction (N38° 06' 31\", W110° 32' 19\") with a major drainage entering from the left. Once at the junction, retrace your steps about 50-yards to a large juniper tree where you can climb out of the drainage and head south. Route find your way up the main ridge. Along the crest of the ridge you will encounter the awe inspiring Arscenic Arch (N38° 06' 20\", W110° 32' 20\") if you look for it. From the arch you must slog 1 1/4 miles southeast to the trailhead. Hiking Information: Hikers can reverse the description presented and visit the arch and the lower section of Arscenic Canyon. How far up canyon you travel depends on your climbing skills. Experienced hikers should be able to visit the arch and a fun section of slot canyon before being turned back.

The beauty of this canyon is spectacular; the narrows are deep, tight, dramatic and fun. The technical section contains an excellent chamber buried deep in the bowels of the slot canyon. This is a fun and technically challenging adventure. General Information: Constrychnine is an exceptional canyon with some of the biggest rappels in the Poison Springs area. Constrychnine requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon is usually dry, with the possibly of knee to waist deep wading. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 5 to 6 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Turkey Knob\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Constrychnine use the WGS84 datum. Constrychnine is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. Two 60 meter ropes are required. The longest rappel in the canyon is 190 feet. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the obstacles can be downclimb instead of rappelled. The canyon currently contains no bolted anchors. This area is considered a bolt free environment. Please do your best to preserve this feature. Numerous canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. The problem solving involved with using natural anchors and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: Any vehicle can access the trailhead during good weather. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 20 miles to mile marker 20.3 (N38° 05' 50\", W110° 37' 17\"). At this point a well-maintained gravel road crosses Highway 95. Turn east onto the well-maintained gravel road and follow it for 5.9 miles to a tee in the road. You will know you are at the correct location if you passed a solar powered pump 250 yards before reaching the tee. Passenger cars might wish to park at the tee to avoid the remaining road, which becomes rougher and sandy. At the tee turn north and follow the road 0.3 miles to the trailhead. You will know you are at the correct location when the road dips down into a shallow sandy wash with several trees. You can pull off the road next to the trees and park. This is the trailhead for Constrychnine, Arscenic, and Slideanide Canyons. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/constrychnine.htm 1/25/2018 Constrychnine - Poison Spring - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 The trailhead is one of the better locations in the area to camp, which is not saying a whole lot. There does not seem to be an abundance of impressive campgrounds in the immediate area. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38° 05' 33\", W110° 31' 34\") follow the dirt road east. Along the way you will pass a small stock pond on the north side of the road. One mile from the trailhead the road will begin to loop south and you will encounter a junction (N38° 05' 46\", W110° 30' 32\") with a faint 4x4 track heading northeast. At this junction you leave the vehicle routes and hike north-northwest for just over 1/2 mile until you intersect the wash that eventual turns into Constrychnine Canyon. The entrance to the canyon (N38° 06' 20\", W110° 30' 49\") and the beginning of the technical section is easy to locate. The first obstacle is a minor dryfall that is easy to walk around. Just beyond the minor dryfall the bottom begins to fall out of the canyon and you will be presented with a 120-foot rappel that is anchored from webbing around a large boulder. The next section of canyon is pleasant with nothing difficult until you reach the second rappel. This is one of the biggest rappels in the Poison Springs area. It is 190-feet down a picturesque slope that deposits you deep in the bowels of the earth. The anchor for this rappel is a deadman located in the sandy wash bottom. The deadman is easy to dig up and inspect. Replace if necessary and carry out all trash. From the bottom of the 190-foot rappel things get really good really fast. Work your way down canyon and enjoy the view. This section contains one sizable downclimb and numerous short downclimbs. Eventually you will reach a 90-foot rappel that is normal anchored with a deadman. The deadman is easy to dig up and inspect. Replace if necessary and carry out all trash. The 90-foot rappel deposits you at the beginning of a spectacular chamber. This is the most stunning visual feature of the canyon. Better enjoy it while you can because the technical section ends shortly. The technical section is approximately 1/2 mile long and is time consuming to navigate. From the chamber continue down canyon for a short distant to where Slideanide joins (N38° 06' 25\", W110° 31' 29\") from the southeast (left). From this junction just keep hiking downstream for 3/4 of a mile to where a major drainage joins (N38° 06' 59\", W110° 31' 37\") from the southwest (left). You will know you are getting close to this junction when you have to begin bushwhacking through some reeds and brush. Fortunately the bushwhacking is very brief. Turn southwest (left) at the junction and begin hiking up the drainage. You will hike up this drainage for nearly 1 mile to a major drainage junction (N38° 06' 31\", W110° 32' 19\"). Arscenic is the canyon entering from the south (left). Hike up Arscenic 50-yards to a large juniper tree where you can climb out of the drainage and head south. Route find your way up the main ridge. Along the crest of the ridge you will encounter an invigorating arch (N38° 06' 20\", W110° 32' 20\"). From the arch you must slog 1 1/4 miles southeast to the trailhead.

The upper section of the West Fork is beautifully molded from the waters that roar through during a thunderstorm. Downclimbing is the name of the game when overcoming most the obstacales the canyon throws at you. Like all good slot canyons this sculpted fantasy of sandstone is powerfully seductive and throbbing with temptation. General Information: Monoxide has a West and East Fork. The West Fork is the charm, fun and action. The East Fork is technical but not that good when compared to what else is available in the area. Monoxide requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon might contain knee to waist deep wading, there should be no swimming required. The canyon is easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 2 to 3 hours for each fork. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Baking Skillet Knoll\" are essential. Each fork of Monoxide is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a mild flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. Each fork of this canyon contains one rappel, the longest being 65 feet. You might encounter additional short rappels depending on your climbing and partner assist skills, a 50 meter rope is required. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchors and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 17 miles to mile marker 17 and the signed Poison Spring turn-off located on the east side of the road. Turn east onto the maintained gravel road and follow it for 5.1 miles to the trailhead. There is nothing to identify the trailhead other than a wide place in the wash where you can park on the side of the road. The intended canyons are clearly visible to the north from the trailhead. Conditions of the Poison Spring Road vary greatly; usually a carefully driven passenger car can reach the trailhead. High clearance vehicle should have no problems reaching the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/monoxide.htm 1/25/2018 Monoxide - Poison Spring - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 trailhead. The biggest obstacle is that the road follows the bottom of the wash for most it's distance and the wash floods a couple of times each year and washes out sections of the road. Approach Route: From the trailhead (N38° 08' 07\", W110° 33' 00\") hike north up the wash for 300 yards to where the East and West Fork of Monoxide join (N38° 08' 17\", W110° 33' 01\"). Hike up the steep slickrock buttress separating the two forks. About midway to the top of the buttress you should encounter a 1922 survey marker (N38° 08' 21\", W110° 32' 56\"). From the survey marker, contour around the buttress to the east for 1/4 mile until you note an easy to ascend slickrock passage to the canyon rim. Once you have reached the canyon rim the routes for the West and East Forks separate (N38° 08' 37\", W110° 32' 39\"). West Fork: The West Fork is the better of the two canyons. From the top of the approach route it is a simple hike over to where the West Fork slot starts (N38° 08' 50\", W110° 32' 43\"). Walk into the top of the slot and let the fun begin. The start of this canyon is exceptionally beautiful. Several short but interesting downclimbs will bring you to the biggest obstacle in the canyon, the fault line rappel. The fault line rappel is a tricky animal and was created when the main watercourse of the canyon teed into a fault line. You will know you are almost there when you reach a downclimb that requires crawling out on a ledge to the north and than climbing down to the canyon bottom. From the top of this downclimb you can easily see that the canyon is about to tee into a massive wall. It is not difficult to reverse your route from the top of the downclimb. I highly recommend you leave at least one member of your group at the top of the downclimb until you have located a safe anchor for the fault line rappel. We anchored this rappel by constructing a deadman in the bottom of a strange pothole/hueco. This is not an easy rappel to rig. If you can not figure it out climb back out the top of the canyon and descend the East Fork. From the bottom of the fault line rappel cruise down canyon and enjoy what remains of the obstacle course. The canyon is deep through this section and contains more downclimbing problems and possible waist deep water. East Fork: Perhaps the nicest thing I can say about the East Fork is that I did it so you don't have to. The East Fork is not nearly as picturesque as the West Fork. It looks impressive on your approach so some canyoneers will not be able to resist the urge to see what is hidden inside. The canyon would make a good winter route with its southern exposure and lack of water. This canyon is also an option to those who are unable to safely rig the fault line rappel in the West Fork. From the top of the approach route it is a simple hike over to where the East Fork begins (N38° 08' 41\", W110° 32' 21\"). Scramble down to the canyon bottom and enjoy the show. You will encounter one mandatory 30-foot rappel in the canyon and abundant downclimbing problems.

The route contains large amounts of downclimbing and partner assists. The canyon is hard on clothing and has a bad habit of \"showing a little cheek\". The technical section ends with one of the most dramatic and angelic exit rappels to be found in a Colorado Plateau slot canyon. General Information: Slideanide is a remarkable canyon with an abundant amount of downclimbing. I strongly suggest wearing a long sleeve shirt and long pants for this slot unless you enjoy raspberries. This canyon is a clothing eater; it is a good idea to leave the latest canyon fashions at home and wear something you expect to thrash. Slideanide requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon contains knee to waist deep wading with no swimming required. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 5 to 6 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Turkey Knob\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Slideanide use the WGS84 datum. Slideanide is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The longest rappel in the canyon is 150 feet, but it can and should be staged so a 60 meter rope should satisfy your needs. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 75 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the numerous drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchors and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: Any vehicle can access the trailhead during good weather. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 20 miles to mile marker 20.3 (N38° 05' 50\", W110° 37' 17\"). At this point a well-maintained gravel road crosses Highway 95. Turn east onto the well-maintained gravel road and follow it for 5.9 miles to a tee in the road. You will know you are at the correct location if you passed a solar powered pump 250 yards before reaching the tee. Passenger cars might wish to park at the tee to avoid the remaining road, which becomes rougher and sandy. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/slideanide.htm 1/25/2018 Slideanide - Poison Spring - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 At the tee turn north and follow the road 0.3 miles to the trailhead. You will know you are at the correct location when the road dips down into a shallow sandy wash with several trees. You can pull off the road next to the trees and park. This is the trailhead for Slideanide, Constrychnine and Arscenic Canyon. The trailhead is one of the better locations in the area to camp, which is not saying a whole lot. There does not seem to be an abundance of impressive campgrounds in the immediate area. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38° 05' 33\", W110° 31' 34\") hike northeast for 3/4 miles until you encounter the Slideanide Drainage. The entrance to the canyon (N38° 06' 06\", W110° 31' 13\") is easy to locate. Where the drainage pours over the entrance dryfall you must downclimb to the large ledge on the north side of the drainage. From the ledge it is easy to locate a large boulder to sling and rappel from. The rappel is 50 feet to the canyon floor. From here until the exit rappel you will be downclimbing numerous drops and chimneys. Most are not difficult if you possess some climbing skills and you use a good partner assist technique. Through this section you will likely encounter at least one knee to waist deep pool of water. The technical section is approximately 1/2 mile long and is time consuming. The Exit Rappel marks the end of the technical section and is extremely impressive. The rappel winds down a magnificently sculpted crack system. The total drop is approximately 150 feet but if you did it as one long rappel it would be nearly impossible to pull your ropes through all the numerous twists and turns. Your best option is to stage the exit rappel into two sections. The Exit Rappel is interrupted by several platforms and wide sections inside the crack. Your best option is to have your first person down locate a good anchor about midway down the crack at one of the platforms. There are several large boulders to sling and locating anchors is not a big problem. Using this method of staging the rappel you should not have a problem pulling your ropes and you should also be able to complete the canyon using only one 60 meter rope. From the bottom of the Exit Rappel hike down canyon for a very short distant to where Constrychnine joins (N38° 06' 25\", W110° 31' 29\") from the east (right). From this junction just keep hiking downstream for 3/4 of a mile to where a major drainage joins (N38° 06' 59\", W110° 31' 37\") from the southwest (left). You will know you are getting close to this junction when you have to begin bushwhacking through some reeds and brush. Fortunately the bushwhacking is very brief. Turn southwest (left) at the junction and begin hiking up the drainage. You will hike up this drainage for nearly 1 mile to a major drainage junction (N38° 06' 31\", W110° 32' 19\"). Arscenic is the canyon entering from the south (left). Hike up Arscenic 50-yards to a large juniper tree where you can climb out of the drainage and head south. Route find your way up the main ridge. Along the crest of the ridge you will encounter an exhilarating arch (N38° 06' 20\", W110° 32' 20\") if you look for it. From the arch you must slog 1 1/4 miles southeast to the trailhead.

This compares favorably to Alcatraz Canyon, which requires the same daring and expertise to flee. This awe-inspiring slot canyon is one of the best in the Robbers Roost area. How did Alcatraz Canyon get its unique and colorful name? Read the complete story for an entertaining tale. General Information: Alcatraz Canyon is a remarkable slot canyon with a large assortment of downclimbing. I strongly suggest wearing a long-sleeve shirt and long pants for this slot unless you enjoy raspberries. This canyon is hard on gear; expect ripped pants, torn shirts, and thrashed packs. This is a physical, technical canyon and requires moderate climbing skills and technique. A headlamp is useful in several of the darkest sections of the slot. Alcatraz Canyon requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon might require knee to chest-deep wading with the possibility of a short swim. The canyon is accessible year-round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 4 to 5 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Angel Point\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Alcatraz Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Alcatraz Canyon is rated 3A R III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. Alcatraz Canyon features what is known as a \"Mae West Slot\" which is a slot so narrow that it is impossible to pass through. This feature forces you to climb up and over the obstacle. Mae West canyons require the use of a \"Mae West bunny\" or bunny strap. This is a length of webbing or a daisy chain with a carabiner attached. This setup that will allow you to hang your pack from your harness while you chimney, climb and stem above and through the narrow slots. A bunny strap is a must-have item. The longest rappel in the canyon is 165 feet. The route requires both a 60 meter rope and a 100-foot rope. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder-length slings, a couple double- length slings, 75 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the numerous drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. Warning: Large-frame canyoneers will have a difficult time descending Alcatraz Canyon. My chest measurement is 43\" around and at times I found it necessary to climb up and over obstacles that Smurf-sized canyoneers could squeeze through. If you have moderate climbing ability and help from friends, you should not get trapped in this canyon no matter your size. Large-frame canyoneers will have to work much harder than Smurf-sized canyoneers to descend this route. All the squeeze obstacles can be defeated by climbing up and over them. However, if you cannot http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/alcatraz.htm 1/25/2018 Alcatraz Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 do the climbing you are in serious trouble. Bring the smallest pack possible. You have been warned! Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road. This area is crisscrossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk. The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon; the South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a signed fork in the road. Take the signed West Fork (right fork) towards Ekker Ranch. Follow the road for 6.8 miles to a fork. The South Fork (left fork) leads to Ekker Rancher and is signed \"Private Property, No Trespassing.\" Take the West Fork (right fork) and follow the road west for 0.5 miles to the Angel Point Junction. A carefully-driven passenger car in good weather can usually reach this junction. To drive from Angel Point Junction to the trailhead, a four wheel drive is advised. High- clearance vehicles can usually make the trailhead, depending on road conditions. The road to the west (right) from Angel Point Junction leads to Angel Point and Larry Canyon. Instead, follow the road straight ahead that leads southwest. Along this section always follow the most well- traveled road. 2.6 miles from Angel Point Junction you will reach the Alcatraz Canyon Trailhead; park anywhere you like. The trailhead is identified by the deep chasm of Alcatraz Canyon to the south. The trailhead makes a reasonable and fun campground if there is little or no wind. If driving this road in the dark, be careful not to drive off the cliff into Alcatraz Canyon! Navigating in this area can be a little confusing to some in the dead of night. Route Information: At the Alcatraz Canyon Trailhead (N38° 16' 43\", W110° 23' 58\") pull your vehicle up to the rim and use it as your rappel anchor. The rappel is 165 feet to the canyon floor. The first 50- feet of this rappel is a spectacular free hanging exploit. Leave the 60 meter rope tied to the vehicle and pick it up when you return. You will only need your 100-foot rope to continue from the bottom of the first rappel. Start climbing down the canyon and enjoy the squeezing and sliding. Shortly you will reach a deep pothole that might require a partner assist to exit. This pothole is about 8 feet deep and can be full of water, completely dry, or anywhere in between. You must rig a rappel anchor from a chokestone on the upstream side of the pothole, to allow you to rappel 25-feet from the lip of the downstream side of the pothole. Below the deep pothole the canyon becomes very tight and interesting. Skinny canyoneers can often squeeze through the bottom while large-frame canyoneers must fight their way over the top. The canyon is filled with swirling sandstone and several natural bridges (if you can see them in the dark confines). You will eventually reach the final rappel that is 20 feet from a bolt into what might be a pool of water. Just past the final rappel there is a very tight squeeze that everyone will be required to climb over. This is the crux of the canyon for most people, and is not too difficult if good partner assist skills are used. Past the crux, the canyon begins to open up and provide several more downclimbing problems. You will note an interesting dam that formed and collapsed where the Navajo and Kayenta sandstone meet. There is one downclimb in this section that some might want to rappel for safety. Continue hiking downcanyon until a tributary joins from the east (N38° 15' 34\", W110° 24' 38\"). At this junction, hike east to the top of the ridge (N38° 15' 25\", W110° 24' 19\"). Follow the emerging hiker trail where possible, to avoid damage to the cryptobiotic soil. Once you are on the ridge you will have great views of the canyons on both sides as you route-find your way north. This is a good place to watch for the bighorn sheep that inhabit the area. When you reach http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/alcatraz.htm 1/25/2018 Alcatraz Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 a large mesa, it is easiest to circle around it to the east. After circling the large mesa, continue north to the canyon rim and the trailhead. Video: A short video of a trip through Alcatraz Canyon in Robbers Roost. Video courtesy of Darin Adlard.

This zestful canyoneering adventure explores some of the most isolated area in the lower 48 states. General Information: The East-West Big Spring Canyon Loop is suitable for intermediate canyoneers with basic natural anchor building skills. This canyon requires complete technical gear. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. This canyon is very remote. Please use caution when assessing risk and remember that mediocre medical care is at least 5 hours away. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 5 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Sugarloaf Butte\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. East-West Big Spring Canyon Loop is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. In normal conditions this canyon is dry with some possible wading. The longest rappel in the canyon is 40 feet with a 20-foot reach at the top. A 50 meter rope is required for this route, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A headlamp might prove useful in the darkest section of this route. Robbers Roost is normally considered a bolt free area, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the charm. Most problems in this canyon are easy to defeat using a little thought and team work. A party of experienced and efficient canyoneers will have no problem completing the East- West Big Spring Canyon Loop and the Northwest Fork of Big Spring Canyon in one day with perhaps a little time to spare. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Your first destination will be the Han's Flat Ranger Station so you can easily follow the signs. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a second fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bigspring.htm 1/25/2018 Big Spring West & East Fork - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed East Fork (left fork) and follow the road 14.2 miles to the Hans Flat Ranger Station (N38° 15' 19\", W110° 10' 47\"). Things can get a little confusing at the Hans Flat Ranger Station because the area is a major junction of roads and there are two signs pointing to Horseshoe Canyon (two different trailheads). One sign points back the way you just came and one sign points north. You want to take the road north signed Horseshoe Canyon. You will know you are on the correct road if the ranger residence is to your immediate west (left) as you pull out of Hans Flat. This road access a section of Robbers Roost referred to as The Spur. From Hans Flat Ranger Station follow the Spur road north for 11.6 to a small pullout on the east (right) side of the road. This is the Big Spring Canyon Trailhead. For reference it should be noted that if you continue driving 1.2 miles north on the Spur road you will reach a junction signed Deadman's Trail (N38° 24' 59\", W110° 8' 56\"). This is also the trailhead for the popular High Spur canyoneering route. If you do not have a GPS you might find it easier to locate the Big Spring Canyon Trailhead by first driving to the signed Deadman's Trail junction and then backtracking. The roads in this area are subject to the whims of the local road grading crew so go prepared. The road is usually in good condition to the Han's Flat Ranger Station, The Spur Road is usually in good condition with several rough spots. Those with four wheel drive should never have a problem reaching the trailhead. A high clearance vehicle will have no problems reaching the trailhead in good weather. I would advise against attempting the road is a passenger vehicle. Route Information: From the Big Spring Canyon Trailhead (N38° 24' 05\" W110° 08' 16\") hike northeast for 1/3 mile into the drainage that forms the West Fork of Big Spring Canyon (N38° 24' 15\" W110° 07' 57\"). Hike down the drainage 1/4 mile to the first rappel (N38° 24' 25\" W110° 07' 58\"). The rappel is approximately 25-feet and is anchored by a small chokestone in the canyon bottom. The second rappel soon follows. The second rappel is approximately 40-feet and is anchored from a chokestone that is 20-feet back from the edge of the drop. Be prepared to replace the webbing at this drop to allow for an easy rope pull and to reduce rope scaring of the sandstone. From the bottom of the second rappel continue down canyon and enjoy the challenging downclimbing and several natural bridges you will find along the way. The canyon gets dark and a headlamp might prove useful. One of the downclimbs you will encounter looks impossible, but if you stem down canyon for approximately 15-feet the canyon narrows and allows for an easier downclimb. Towards the end of this canyon you will encounter a section that it looks like a good place to escape back to the rim, but keep hiking until you reach a downclimb that has you climbing through a triple bridge. After the triple bridge you will reach an escape (N38° 24' 46\" W110° 07' 55\") to the east (right). Exit the canyon and route find your way to the top of the nose (N38° 24' 41\" W110° 07' 51\"). From the top of the nose hike south taking the path of least resistance to the head of East Fork of Big Spring Canyon (N38° 24' 17\" W110° 07' 44\"). At the head of East Fork of Big Spring Canyon you will discover a large drop. Rim walk east (right) approximately 100-yards and route find into the canyon bottom. There are no rappels in this canyon, however some of the downclimbs may require some spotting or hand lines for less skilled canyoneers. The canyon may have one pool to wade (or possibly swim) near the end. After the pool hike down canyon to an escape (N38° 24' 45\" W110° 07' 47\") on the west (left) side of the canyon. Climb up a very small side drainage to the top with some steep hiking where you can reach the top of a ridge. Immediately in front of you is another small drainage which you will need to cross and then hike up the nose you climbed earlier in the day and back to the trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bigspring.htm 1/25/2018 Big Spring West & East Fork - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 Video: An entertaining video of a trip through the East Fork of Big Spring Canyon.

If you are searching for solitude and isolation this is the place. The canyon is located in one of the most remote and majestic regions in the lower 48 states. General Information: The Northwest Fork of Big Spring Canyon is suitable for intermediate canyoneers with basic natural anchor building skills. This canyon requires complete technical gear. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. This canyon is very remote. Please use caution when assessing risk and remember that mediocre medical care is at least 5 hours away. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 4 to 5 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Sugarloaf Butte\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Northwest Fork of Big Spring Canyon is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. In normal conditions this canyon is dry with some possible wading. The longest rappel in the canyon is 70 feet. A 50 meter rope is required for this route, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Robbers Roost is normally considered a bolt free area, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the charm. Most problems in this canyon are easy to defeat using a little thought and team work. A party of experienced and efficient canyoneers will have no problem completing the Northwest Fork of Big Spring Canyon and the East-West Big Spring Canyon Loop in one day with perhaps a little time to spare. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Your first destination will be the Han's Flat Ranger Station so you can easily follow the signs. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a second fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bigspringnw.htm 1/25/2018 Big Spring Northwest Fork - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed East Fork (left fork) and follow the road 14.2 miles to the Hans Flat Ranger Station (N38° 15' 19\", W110° 10' 47\"). Things can get a little confusing at the Hans Flat Ranger Station because the area is a major junction of roads and there are two signs pointing to Horseshoe Canyon (two different trailheads). One sign points back the way you just came and one sign points north. You want to take the road north signed Horseshoe Canyon. You will know you are on the correct road if the ranger residence is to your immediate west (left) as you pull out of Hans Flat. This road access a section of Robbers Roost referred to as The Spur. From Hans Flat Ranger Station follow the Spur road north for 12.8 miles to a road leading west (left) signed Deadman's Trail (N38° 24' 59\", W110° 8' 56\"). At this junction veer east (right) staying on the Spur road for an additional 0.6 miles to where you will find a place to park on the west (left) side of the road. This is the trailhead for the West Fork of Big Spring Canyon. The roads in this area are subject to the whims of the local road grading crew so go prepared. The road is usually in good condition to the Han's Flat Ranger Station, The Spur Road is usually in good condition with several rough spots. Those with four wheel drive should never have a problem reaching the trailhead. A high clearance vehicle will have no problems reaching the trailhead in good weather. I would advise against attempting the road in a passenger vehicle. Route Information: From the Northwest Fork of Big Spring Trailhead (N38° 25' 29\" W110° 08' 43\"), hike due east passing a hoodoo and into the drainage. Begin hiking downstream and shortly you will encounter the first rappel. The rappel is 35-feet from a natural anchor that you might need to construct. With a little exploring you should be able to find a few good rocks. Some have rappelled from hooks at this location but hooks may not release if located at the safest placements. The route contains some fun downclimbing where teamwork and a partner assist will pay dividends. If conditions are muddy it will make some of these obstacles difficult. The second rappel is 70-feet from a huge chokestone. You will have to climb over the top of the chokestone to start the rappel. If you look up canyon from the huge chokestone you will see an old bolt sticking 1/2 inch out of the canyon wall. It makes you wonder what came first - the chokestone or the bolt? If the anchor isn't extended at least 10 to 20-feet from the large chokestone you may want to do so as it will reduce scaring of the sandstone and allow for an easier rope pull. Given the low angle start it is possible to do this by tying in a few loops on the extended webbing, which makes starting the rappel easier. This rappel will require two stages and rounds a corner. At the base of the second rappel the canyon becomes very dark and impressive. The slot has some sideways shuffling and is very nice. Once the slot ends hike down stream until you can escape out the north (left) side of the canyon (N38° 25' 49\" W110° 07' 58\"). Route find your way to the rim and intersect an old 4x4 track (N38° 25' 56\" W110° 08' 15\"). Follow the old 4x4 track southwest and it will lead you back to the Spur road. Once you reach the Spur road its a short walk south to the trailhead. Video: A short video of a trip through Big Spring Northwest Fork. Video courtesy of Darin Adlard.

There are several popular routes through the canyon with each offering it's own charm. All routes contain several miles of premium narrows and enjoyable desert hiking. This canyon contains some of the best slots in the area. They are very scenic and refreshing. In April 2003, Bluejohn Canyon acquired a mystical reputation by way of the Aron Ralston epic, when a canyoneer was forced to amputate his own arm in order to survive the canyon. Interested in viewing a short video clip which was shot in the East and Main Forks of Bluejohn Canyon? This video was taken the first week of March and the water temperature was still very cold. *Bluejohn Canyon Video* General Information: Bluejohn Canyon is a spectacular canyoneering adventure offering numerous routes for all abilities. The canyon contains technical canyoneering routes along with routes that allow hikers to enjoy the slots. The routes listed for this canyon range in length from half a day to a very long day depending on skill level and route selection. This canyon usually contains no swimming in normal conditions but knee to waist deep wading is common. A GPS is extremely useful for navigating in this area. All waypoints and maps for Bluejohn Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Always check your GPS to ensure that WGS84 is the datum before entering a waypoint into your unit. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Robbers Roost Flats\" and \"Whitbeck Knoll\" are essential. Those wanting to complete the canyon through to the Great Gallery in Horseshoe Canyon will also require the \"Sugarloaf Butte\" map. Navigation for the routes listed is moderate. The East Fork of Bluejohn requires several miles of cross-country navigation. History: Bluejohn Canyon appears to have been named after a minor Robbers Roost outlaw by the name of John Griffith. Griffith had one blue eye and one brown eye and thus was saddled with the nickname \"Blue John\". It is recognized that he kept stolen horses in the area, perhaps watering them at Granary Spring. In the fall of 1899 Griffith is reported to have put in at Hite with a small boat with the intention of reaching Lee's Ferry. He was never heard from again. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile beyond the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Follow the well-maintained dirt road for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk. The Left Fork leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the Right Fork leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the Right Fork south for 7.1 miles to a signed fork in the road. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bluejohn.htm 1/25/2018 Bluejohn - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 6 Take the Left Fork toward the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Follow the road for 2.6 miles to a minor dirt road on the left. Follow the minor dirt road for 0.2 miles to several old line camp buildings. This is the Granary Spring Trailhead (N38° 20' 30\", W110° 17' 33\"). The Granary Spring Trailhead is the best place in the vicinity to camp. You will have to tolerate the occasional cow, which wanders through camp on its way to the spring for a drink. A carefully driven passenger car in good weather can usually reach the trailhead. However, the roads in this area are subject to the whims of the road grading crew so go prepared. Alternate Trailhead: An optional car shuttle will cut off approximately 3 miles of road walking off several adventures and allow easier access to the canyon for other routes. From the Granary Springs Trailhead drive back 0.2 miles to the main road. Drive North on the main road for 2.6 miles to the signed fork in the road. Continue North on the Main road for an additional 0.2 miles until you notice a metal culvert crossing under the road. This is the Alternate Trailhead (N38° 22' 47\", W110° 18' 14\"). Main Fork Route Information: The Main Fork of Bluejohn Canyon is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required for this adventure is 7 to 8 hours from Granary Springs to Granary Springs without a car shuttle. An optional car shuttle will eliminate several miles of road walking and reduce the required time proportionally. In normal conditions the Main Fork is usually dry or contains only easy to avoid water. The Main Fork of Bluejohn Canyon requires complete technical gear. A 100-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. From the Granary Springs Trailhead hike down the canyon to the metal trough at Granary Spring (N38° 20' 31\", W110° 17' 26\"). From the spring continue hiking down canyon and enjoy the scenery. Two miles below the spring you will encounter your first and only rappel. This is also the beginning of the narrows. The rappel anchor (N38° 22' 08\", W110° 16' 54\") is a chokestone in the canyon bottom. Experienced climbers can downclimb this entire obstacle. The 250 yards of canyon from the rappel anchor down is the only real technical difficulty on this route. The rappel is 20 feet, followed by some moderately difficult and time-consuming downclimbing. This section is easy to protect by slinging one of the numerous chokestones if you feel uncomfortable with the downclimbing involved. Please do not place bolts in this canyon, there are numerous and simple to locate natural anchors available. The next 1-1/4 miles contains spectacular narrows. The Narrows end where Little Bluejohn enters from the west (N38° 23' 06\", W110° 16' 37\"). From the Little Bluejohn junction continue downstream as the Main Fork of Bluejohn begins to open up. 1-mile below the Little Bluejohn junction the Main Exit (N38° 23' 37\", W110° 15' 59\") is easy to located on the west side of the canyon. Or you can continue hiking downstream an additional 1/4 mile and exit using the easy to locate and more exciting West Fork of Bluejohn (N38° 23' 41\", W110° 15' 42\"). East Fork Standard Route Information: The East Fork of Bluejohn Canyon is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required for this adventure is 7 to 9 hours from Granary Springs to Granary Springs without a car shuttle. An optional car shuttle will eliminate several miles of road walking and reduce the required time proportionally. In normal conditions the East Fork contains several sections of knee to waist deep wading and one pothole that is often chest deep. The East Fork of Bluejohn Canyon requires complete technical gear. A 100-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bluejohn.htm 1/25/2018 Bluejohn - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 6 From the Granary Springs Trailhead hike down the canyon to the metal trough at Granary Spring (N38° 20' 31\", W110° 17' 26\"). From the spring continue hiking down canyon. Five minutes after leaving the spring stop (N38° 20' 40\", W110° 17' 20\") and look east. Pick an easy route to the top of the ridge (N38° 20' 43\", W110° 17' 08\"). When you reach the top of the ridge you should be able to see a large open area to the east we call the pasture (N38° 20' 55\", W110° 16' 25\"). Pick an easy route and start hiking for the pasture, which is approximately one-mile distance. When you reach the pasture head east for an additional 1/4-mile and you should run directly into the East Fork of Bluejohn Canyon (N38° 20' 48\", W110° 16' 08\"). Start hiking down the canyon and enjoy. Your first real obstacle is a dryfall into a tight little slot. Bypass to the right (LDC) and locate an easy walk down 100 yards down canyon. Large frame canyoneers might feel more comfortable skipping the first walk down and rim walking about 1/4 mile down canyon before dropping in. The very top portion of East Fork contains a shallow but narrow slot. From here on down the canyon begins to slot up with some great swirling narrows. The next mile of canyon is a fun scramble to the only rappel in the canyon. The rappel is a 20-foot drop into a pothole, which will probably be waist to chest deep with water. The rappel anchor is a bolt on the left (LDC) wall. From the rappel, climb through a few obstacles and continue down canyon for 200-feet. You will meet a junction with a tight slot joining from the west. The tight slot joining from the west is the bottom of the Squeeze Variation (N38° 21' 42\", W110° 16' 06\"). At this junction the personality of the canyon changes dramatically. The swirling narrows are gone as we enter a very deep, dark and beautiful slot. This section of canyon usually contains some knee deep wading. Enjoy the stroll for the next 1-1/2 miles through these spectacular narrows. Eventually the canyon opens up and you will spend the next 45 minutes (1-3/4 miles) hiking down a sandy canyon bottom to the junction with the West Fork of Bluejohn (N38° 23' 41\", W110° 15' 42\"). At this point you have the option of exiting out the interesting West Fork of Bluejohn or you can hike up the Main Fork of Bluejohn 1/4-mile and exit to the west using the easy to locate Main Exit (N38° 23' 37\", W110° 15' 59\"). East Fork Squeeze Variation: The Squeeze Variation of the East Fork of Bluejohn Canyon is anther interesting entrance to the deep, dark and beautiful slot. Total time required for this adventure is 7 to 9 hours from Granary Springs to Granary Springs with no car shuttle. This is a much more advanced entrance than the Standard Route into the East Fork and contains sections of what is known as a Mae West slot. The Squeeze Variation is rated 3A III R using the Canyon Rating System. This entrance is for expert canyoneers only. Good climbing skills are required. Large frame canyoneers will have a difficult if not impossible time descending the East Fork Squeeze Variation. Most of the squeeze obstacles can be defeated by climbing up and over them. Rescuing a stuck or trapped canyoneer from this slot would be extremely difficult. Bring as small of pack as possible. You have been warned! The Squeeze Variation requires complete technical gear. A 100-foot rope, several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. In normal conditions the Squeeze Variation contains several sections of knee to waist deep wading. The Squeeze Variation is basically the same route as the Standard East Fork Route with the exception of when you reach the top of the ridge (N38° 20' 43\", W110° 17' 08\") you want to descend to the bottom of the wash on the east side of the ridge and follow it north. The route contains several downclimbs or short rappels and ends in a very narrow and dark section. The variation route rejoins the Standard East Fork Route (N38° 21' 42\", W110° 16' 06\") at the top of the deep, dark narrows and 200-feet below the 20-foot rappel into a pothole. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bluejohn.htm 1/25/2018 Bluejohn - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 4 of 6 Little Bluejohn: Little Bluejohn Canyon is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required for this adventure is 3 to 4 hours if parking at the Alternate Trailhead and not exploring the Main Fork of Bluejohn. This route is normally dry or contains easy to avoid water. Little Bluejohn requires complete technical gear. A 50-meter rope, several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. From the Alternate Trailhead (N38° 22' 47\", W110° 18' 14\") hike east for 3/4 miles and you will encounter a wash (N38° 22' 37\", W110° 17' 28\"), begin hiking down the wash and let the fun begin. You will pass an interesting little arch on the north side of the wash as you hike down the wash to the first rappel. The first major obstacle and what amounts to the beginning of the slot is a 25-foot dryfall that can be downclimbed by the experienced or rappelled by the timid. The canyon slots up quickly and contains two twisting 70-foot rappels through tight, swirling sandstone. From the bottom of the second rappel you will encounter some short narrows before intersecting Main Bluejohn (N38° 23' 06\", W110° 16' 37\"). From the junction of Little Bluejohn and Main Bluejohn you are presented with numerous options. The quickest way back to your vehicle is to hike down Main Bluejohn and exit using the Main Exit (N38° 23' 37\", W110° 15' 59\") or the West Fork of Bluejohn (N38° 23' 41\", W110° 15' 42\"). However, since you are at the bottom of the best narrows in the Main Fork you will probably want to hike up canyon and spend an hour or two exploring the Main Fork narrows. West Fork (Exit Route) Information: The West Fork of Bluejohn Canyon is often used to exit Bluejohn Canyon. This is not the easiest exit route but you do get to visit an additional slot section. If you are simply looking for the easiest method of exiting the canyon use the \"Main Exit\" noted below. If you want the adventure exit this is the place. The only major obstacle in the West Fork is a dryfall near the top. There are two popular options for getting past the dryfall. The first option is a 3rd class traverse to the left (LUC) up across some very loose rock with some exposure. The second option is to climb the groove in the dryfall that is 5.6 with some exposure. To exit via the West Fork begin at the junction (N38° 23' 37\", W110° 15' 59\") where the West, East and Main Forks all join together. Hike up the West Fork of Bluejohn for 2-1/2 miles until you intersect a sandy 4x4 track (N38° 23' 24\", W110° 17' 48\"). Hike south on the sandy 4x4 track and you will intersect the main road. You might as well enjoy the stroll because it's nearly 4 miles of road walking back to the Granary Spring Trailhead. You might get lucky and hitch a ride on the main road. Main Exit: In the Main Fork of Bluejohn Canyon, approximately 1/4 mile south of where the West, East and Main Forks all join together (N38° 23' 37\", W110° 15' 59\"), you will find numerous easy exits out of the canyon. You will be required to route find your way west to a sandy 4x4 track (N38° 23' 24\", W110° 17' 48\"). This route is shorter and faster than the West Fork Exit, but you will miss a short section of fun narrows. Route finding your way cross-country in this area is very easy. It is almost impossible to get lost because if you keep heading west you will eventually meet up with the 4x4 track or the Main Road. The terrain in this area is open desert. This is the easiest method of exiting or entering Bluejohn canyon. Optional Route - East and Main Fork: Probably the absolute best way to see Bluejohn Canyon is to hike down the East Fork and up the Main Fork. Total time required for this adventure is 8 to 9 hours from Granary Springs to Granary Springs. This route is not easy and is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. There is a section of 5.7 off-width climbing involved. The climbing is the most difficult part of http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bluejohn.htm 1/25/2018 Bluejohn - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 5 of 6 the route and is located at the only rappel in the Main Fork. You must climb at a level of 5.6 to 5.7 for 200 yards up an off-width slot. Fortunately, the exposure is very minimal. If you can’t do the section of climbing you will be forced to backtrack and use the Main Exit. Do not attempt this optional route with beginners or non-climbers. Bottom line is experienced slot rats will have little problem with this route while posers may be forced to seek an alternative exit. Optional Route - Main Fork: Perhaps the simplest way to visit just the Main Fork of Bluejohn is to park your vehicle at the metal culvert at the Alternate Trailhead. From the Metal Culvert, walk south on the main road to the top of the knoll and than route find your way east to the top of the rappel into Bluejohn Canyon (N38° 22' 08\", W110° 16' 54\"). This route will cut off several miles of hiking and you will not miss any of the narrows. Route finding your way cross-country in this area is very easy if you can read a map or use a GPS. The terrain in this area is mostly open desert. Bluejohn Canyon to Horseshoe Canyon: Bluejohn Canyon to Horseshoe Canyon is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. A vehicle shuttle is required to complete this route. You might encounter some knee deep wading but most water can be avoided with a little effort. Total time required for this adventure is 8 to 10 hours depending on your entrance option. I would suggest beginning this route by entering through Little Bluejohn, West Fork of Bluejohn or using the Main Exit. I would advise against beginning at Granary Springs since this would create a very long day. Some canyoneers refer to a complete Main Fork of Bluejohn and Horseshoe Canyon as the \"Ralston Route\", because this was the route that resulted in Aron Ralston's now famous epic. However you choose to enter Bluejohn your first objective is the same. You must hike down canyon to the junction (N38° 23' 41\", W110° 15' 42\") of West, East and Main Forks of Bluejohn. From the junction hike down canyon for about 1 1/2-miles to the beginning of the narrows. The section of narrows is only about 1/4-mile long but they are deep, dark and dramatic. This section of narrows has become legendary since this is where the Aron Ralston epic took place. The narrows consist of several entertaining downclimbs and one 70-foot rappel at the end of the section. Two bolts on the left (LDC) anchor this rappel. There is often a pool at the bottom of the rappel, which can be avoided with some cleaver rappelling. For those who just have to know, Aron Ralston was trapped about 100 yards up canyon from the 70-foot rappel. The spot was easy to identify in the fall of 2003. From the rappel it is about 2 3/4 miles downstream to the junction where Bluejohn joins Horseshoe Canyon (N38° 25' 27\", W110° 13' 37\"). From the junction, just keep hiking downstream, it is a 2 1/4 mile hike to the Great Gallery in Horseshoe Canyon (N38° 26' 49\", W110° 12' 47\"). The Great Gallery is considered to be one of the most distinguished displays of pictographs in the world. This is the site that all other pictographs are measured against. From the Great Gallery it is a 3 3/4 mile hike out to the Horseshoe Canyon Trailhead (N38° 28' 25\", W110° 12' 01\"). The route passes by three additional pictograph sites and several dinosaur tracks. If you are attempting to retrace Aron Ralston's exact route he descended the Main Fork of Bluejohn with the intention of exiting at the Horseshoe Canyon Trailhead. Hiking Information: It is possible for enterprising hikers to visit nearly all of the narrows in Bluejohn Canyon. The hiking options carry a rating of 2A III using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required for the hiking option is 4 to 10 hours depending on how much and which areas you wish to visit. Hikers will want to enter Bluejohn using the \"Main Exit\" or West Fork route listed above. My advice is to not climb down anything you cannot climb back up and you should be safe. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bluejohn.htm 1/25/2018 Bluejohn - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 6 of 6 An enjoyable half-day adventure for experienced hikers would be to enter Bluejohn using the Main Exit and visit the Main Fork narrows. Hikers can visit the complete Main Fork narrows by entering from the bottom. A fun full day adventure for experienced hikers would be to enter Bluejohn using the Main Exit and explore the East Fork narrows. Hikers can visit nearly all of the East Fork narrows to the junction of the Standard Route and Squeeze Variation (N38° 21' 42\", W110° 16' 06\").

A slot with spectacular chambers that inspired the canyons name? This should be interesting. General Information: Chambers is an artistic slot canyon accessible to the advanced canyoneer, or to the intermediate canyoneer with advanced leadership. This is not a slot canyon suitable for beginners. Chambers is rated 3A II R using the Canyon Rating System and does contain several sections of mae west type slot and a short chimney climb rated 5.8 to 5.9ish depending on conditions. For the skilled canyoneer the problems inside the slot are straight forward. Chambers requires complete technical gear. There are no mandatory rappels in this canyon but a 30-foot rope for belays, handlines, emergencies and pack lowering is highly advised. Additional gear should consist of a mae west bunny strap, several slings, 25 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. As small of pack as possible is highly advised. This canyon is normally dry, but occasionally the slot will require minor waist to chest deep wading. Wetsuits are not required in normal warm weather conditions. The canyon is accessible year round but mid summer would not be pleasant. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 4 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Angel Cove\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Chambers use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. Warning: At least one person has become \"Stuck in Chambers\". Large frame canyoneers will not fit through Chambers. The canyon is not as tight as some slots but there is certainly an upper limit. What that upper limit is exactly has never been established, but here are a few guidelines. If you can not squeeze through a 12\" wide opening you will not fit through this canyon. You can not climb up and over the constrictions in this slot as you can in some other tight slots. If you can squeeze through a 10\" wide opening you will be forced off the ground several times, you will be forced up even more if you fit into the 12\" wide opening category. The canyon pinches tight down low and widens slightly above. The ability to visualize where your hips, shoulders and midsection will fit is key as you slither through sideways dragging your pack behind. Becoming wedged inside this canyon could be a life threatening situation. You have been warned! Full Meal Deal: Chambers combines nicely into a single route with Lost Angel. Those that know how to read a map will notice Chambers meets the Dirty Devil opposite the canyon known as Lost Angel. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/chambers.htm 1/25/2018 Chambers - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Lost Angel is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. Combining Lost Angel and Chambers into a single route, using the Lost Angel Trailhead, makes for a nice day and allows easy passenger vehicle access to Chambers without having to drive deep into the heart of Robbers Roost with a high clearance vehicle. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 15.4 miles to an intersection at the top of a hill (N38° 29' 58\", W110° 24' 52\"). This is known locally as \"Texas Hill\" and a ranch is visible just to the south of the intersection. From the intersection turn south (right) and follow the dirt road past the ranch buildings, and through a gate. Please be friendly and drive slowly through the ranch compound. From the Texas Hill intersection follow the dirt road south for 8.2 miles to a junction (N38° 24' 23\", W110° 27' 06\"). The main road leads west (right). Turn south (left) and follow the smaller dirt road south for 2.1 miles to a fork, take the east (left) fork, follow the road 2.8 miles to a fork, take the west (right) fork. Follow the road 1.2 miles to the Chambers Trailhead. You have reached the trailhead when the road ends at a nice canyon overlook. Access to the Chambers Trailhead requires a high clearance vehicle in normal weather conditions. There are no really great campsites in this area, but you will pass several serviceable campsites driving down the last section of road. This route is often combined over a weekend with White Roost, and the White Roost trailhead/campsite is the most popular in the area. Route Information: From the Chambers Trailhead (N38° 20' 03\", W110° 31' 01\",) hike west into a drainage and follow the drainage down to where it drops into a deep slot. The deep slot is Chambers. To access chambers rim walk the slot northeast a short distance until you reach a point where the Chambers drainage is easy to enter. The slot begins where the the bottom drops out of the open wash (N38° 20' 18\", W110° 31' 28\"). It appears as if you can stem over the slot, but you will soon realize that it doesn't end and you will need to backtrack and downclimb into the slot. Once in the slot enjoy the squeezing and downclimbing. Being able to visualize where your hips, shoulders and midsection will fit is the key as you slither sideways dragging your pack behind you. The ability to scan down canyon and realize where you need to stay high before reaching a particular obstacle is a large benefit to conserving energy and advantageous to those with a larger frame. After approximately 2 hours of tight slot the unique signature feature known as the Chamber Rooms is reached. You might encounter occasional pools of water in this section if it has rained recently. Enjoy the Chamber Rooms, rest and take some pictures. The chambers are a unique feature with several rooms to explore that pinch off to less than a foot overhead. After the chamber section continue downstream as there is still more canyon ahead. The section after the Chamber Rooms will require approximately 45 minutes to negotiate. You will reach a large chokestone at the top of a downclimb into a shallow pothole. Taking off your pack, downclimbing, and lowering your pack seems to work best. Shortly after this pothole is the canyon crux. There is a pocket to your west (right) that provides a nice stance/rest before the slot sucks you in and becomes so tight that it is impassible for all but the tiniest canyoneer. You will know you are in the right place if the slot gets tighter and tighter - simply back out into the pocket. This is a good time to put your harness on. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/chambers.htm 1/25/2018 Chambers - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 From the pocket is where you want to up-climb. The crux move is about 5.9ish and requires climbing up approximately 12-feet maximum. The crux move becomes easier with a partner assist from below and/or a handline from above. Once above the crux there is a nice mini ledge for a solid belay stance that will accommodate your feet while your back is pressed against the opposing wall. This mini ledge is useful for setting up a belay or handline. Use caution at the mini ledge as the rock is crumbly in places. From the mini ledge stem down canyon, crossing a mini silo (hang your pack from a bunny strap), until you can once again downclimb into the slot. Continue squeezing down canyon slithering your body through the canyon until the slot abruptly ends (N38° 20' 07\" W110° 31' 48\"). From the abrupt end of the slot hike downstream for 1/4 mile to where a large, easy to climb, sand hill (N38° 20' 11\" W110° 32' 06\") on the east (left) allows access to the slickrock above. Once you are on the slickrock above the canyon bottom hike east to the Chambers Trailhead. You can save a bunch of energy and climbing by skirting the slickrock knolls on the north (left), there is no need to summit the knolls. Video: Watching a short video is the only way to capture the fun and feeling to be had in this fantastic slot canyon. The video is compliments of Eric Godfrey (Shaggy).

That was the rumor that lead us to this sweet canyon located in the heart of outlaw country once frequented by the notorious Wild Bunch. If you are searching for solitude and isolation this is it. The canyon is located in one of the most remote and impressive regions in the lower 48 states. General Information: High Spur is a highly photogenic slot canyon with an assortment of opportunities. This canyon requires complete technical gear. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. In normal conditions this canyon might require some wading. The canyon has been known to contain swimming immediately after a storm or during wet periods. This canyon is very remote and drains a section of Robber's Roost known as the High Spur. Please use caution when assessing risk and remember that mediocre medical care is at least 5 hours away. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 6 to 7 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Sugarloaf Butte\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. High Spur is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. High Spur contains at least one mandatory rappel. Depending on your skills you might encounter additional rappels. The longest rappel in the canyon is 80 feet. A 50 meter rope is required for this route, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 75 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the charm. Most problems in this canyon are easy to defeat using a little teamwork. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Your first destination will be the Han's Flat Ranger Station so you can easily follow the signs. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/highspur.htm 1/25/2018 High Spur - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a second fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed East Fork (left fork) and follow the road 14.2 miles to the Hans Flat Ranger Station (N38° 15' 19\", W110° 10' 47\"). Things can get a little confusing at the Hans Flat Ranger Station because the area is a major junction of roads and there are two signs pointing to Horseshoe Canyon (two different trailheads). One sign points back the way you just came and one sign points north. You want to take the road north signed Horseshoe Canyon. You will know you are on the correct road if the ranger residence is to your immediate west (left) as you pull out of Hans Flat. This road access a section of Robbers Roost referred to as The Spur. From Hans Flat Ranger Station follow The Spur road north for 12.8 miles to a road leading west (left) signed Deadman's Trail. This junction is the High Spur Canyon Trailhead. The roads in this area are subject to the whims of the local road grading crew so go prepared. The road is usually in good condition to the Han's Flat Ranger Station, The Spur Road is usually in good condition with several rough spots. Those with four wheel drive should never have a problem reaching the trailhead. A high clearance vehicle will have no problems reaching the trailhead in good weather. I would advise against attempting the road is a passenger vehicle. There is no camping at the immediate trailhead. There is reasonable camping 1.5 miles west on Deadman's Trail at an old Drill Hole. It also appears that a little exploring might yield several nice primitive campsites in the area. Route Information: Do not try and short-cut the entrance to the start of this canyon. Take a few extra minutes and hike to the actual head of the slot. Several of the side drainages appear to be inviting options. The problem with entering through one of the side drainages is that they all cut off large chucks of the best slot, some chunks are larger than others. Don't cheat yourself by being in a hurry. From the High Spur Trailhead (N38° 24' 59\", W110° 8' 56\"), hike cross country 1/2 mile south to the head of High Spur Canyon (N38° 24' 30\", W110° 9' 13\"). The correct entrance to this slot is an easy walk down, simply follow the canyon downstream. Almost immediately you will encounter a large rock fall blocking the canyon that you must climb over or squeeze through. Not long after the rock fall you will encounter a really unique feature known as \"The Circle\". The Circle is an extremely deep section of slot canyon that makes a 400-yard loop. When viewed from the canyon rim the feature forms nearly a perfect circle. If the light is right The Circle might yield some extraordinary photographs. Below The Circle the canyon alternates between open and slot. Hike downstream and enjoy the stroll. You will encounter several side canyons that can be explored by those looking for a longer day. Approximately midway through the canyon you will encounter a 15-foot drop. Its possible to partner assist down this obstacle with a handline from above and a spot from below. Or you can take the safe route and setup a rappel. Continue hiking down canyon and you will eventually arrive at \"The Corkscrew\". This is very photogenic section of canyon that weaves back and forth in a strange and beautiful rhythm. After exiting the corkscrew continue snaking through more enchanting narrows until encountering a 20-foot swirling dryfall. Again, this dryfall can be downclimbed or rappelled after weighing skill versus risk. Almost immediately after the dryfall you will reach the final/mandatory rappel (N38° 24' 25\", W110° 11' 10\"). The 80-feet rappel is easy to anchor from one of several large boulders and is free hanging. From the bottom of the mandatory rappel continue hiking downstream 1/2 mile to the easily located Exit Crack (N38° 24' 15\", W110° 11' 36\") in the north (right) canyon wall. Climb up through the 4th class Exit Crack to the top of the sandstone wall. From the top of the Exit Crack head northeast and route find your way through the rock bands until you intersect the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/highspur.htm 1/25/2018 High Spur - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 Deadman's Trail (N38° 24' 56\", W110° 11' 11\"). After interesting the Deadman's Trail (really a 4x4 road) just follow it 2 1/2 miles east back to the trailhead. Historical Information: The Spur was used by the Tidwell brothers to run cattle beginning about 1920. In 1926 the Phillips Petroleum Company started drilling for oil in the area. The drilling operation was abandoned after 3 or 4 years and the buildings erected by Phillips Petroleum became the headquarters for the Tidwell Ranch.

[ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Larry Canyon Robbers Roost Technical Canyoneering Rumor had it that Larry Canyon was one of the crown jewels of the Robbers Roost area. The canyon was said to contain dramatic scenery and swirling sandstone narrows. Problem was that I had been told vastly different stories about the difficulty and time required. The information I was hearing was greatly mixed. Some mentioned a brutal 10 hour day while others mentioned a refreshing 5 hour romp. So what was the truth, why are some groups suffering and others frolicking? These questions and many more will be answered. General Information: Larry Canyon is a remarkable slot canyon with an assortment of downclimbing. Some will want to wear a long sleeve shirt and long pants in this slot to avoid minor raspberries. A headlamp might be required in several of the darkest sections of slot. Larry Canyon requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon might require knee to waist deep wading. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 7 to 8 hours. A GPS is extremely useful in locating the Exit Crack. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Robbers Roost Flats\" and \"Angel Point\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Larry Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Larry Canyon is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The longest mandatory rappel in the canyon is 70 feet and requires a 150-foot rope. A 60 meter rope is required for those completing the canyon using the optional exit rappel. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 75 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the numerous drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchors and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #147 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South (right) Fork leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/larry.htm 1/25/2018 Larry Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a signed fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed West (right) Fork towards Ekker Ranch. Follow the road for 6.8 miles to a fork (N38° 17' 54\", W110° 21' 14\"), The South (left) Fork leads to Ekker Rancher and is signed \"Private Property, No Trespassing\". Take the West (right) Fork and follow the road west for 0.5 miles to the Angel Point Junction (N38° 17' 48\", W110° 21' 45\"). To reach the Larry Canyon Trailhead from Angel Point Junction turn west (right) towards Angel Point and continue for 1.1 miles until you cross a shallow wash. This is the Larry Canyon Trailhead. A carefully driven passenger car in good weather can usually reach the trailhead. However, the roads in this area are subject to the whims of the road grading crew so go prepared. Blowing sand and migrating sand dunes occasionally block the roads. Optional Shuttle Trailhead: To complete the optional shuttle it is recommended that both your vehicles be four wheel drives. A shuttle will eliminate 2 hours and 4 miles of hiking. A shuttle turns this canyon into a fantastic 5 or 6 hour frolic in the desert. From Angel Point Junction follow the road southwest (straight ahead) for 3.9 miles, always following the most well traveled road. Park anywhere you like, this is the Optional Shuttle Trailhead. There is nothing in the immediate area to identify the Optional Shuttle Trailhead. There are several descent campsites along the last 1.3 miles of road beginning at Alcatraz Canyon and ending near the Optional Shuttle Trailhead. If driving this road in the dark be careful not to drive off the cliff into Alcatraz Canyon, it can be a little confusing to some in the dead of night. The Larry Canyon shuttle can be completed with high clearance vehicles with varying amounts of success depending on road conditions and the migrating sand dunes. Those with a single four wheel drive vehicle might consider starting from the Optional Shuttle Trailhead. The advantages are it will eliminate about 3/4 miles of monotonous hiking since you can hike to the beginning of the slot and not the actual trailhead. The second major advantage is the tedious trek is now done in the cool morning instead of being a hot afternoon slog. Route Information: From the Larry Canyon Trailhead (N38° 18' 17\", W110° 22' 44\") hike southwest down the wash. The first big drop (N38° 18' 03\", W110° 23' 04\") can be rappelled or carefully downclimbed on the south side near some worn out Moki steps. Below the Moki steps the canyon narrows into a slot and becomes progressively deeper and narrower with numerous squeezes and obstacles. A chokestone anchors a 75-foot rappel into a pothole that will require wading when filled with water. 100 feet further down canyon a second 50-foot rappel anchored by a chokestone bypasses a pothole that might contain water and deposits you on the narrow canyon floor. Below the two mandatory rappels the canyon opens up slightly allowing for an enjoyable stroll and than drops into an endless sideways squeeze slot that evolves into a long, slightly wider but uncomfortably left-tilting slot, often referred to as the slanted hallway. The sideways tilt, dragging your pack, and crawling along the wall is not difficult but it is tiring. After exiting the slanted corridor the canyon widens out and there is an optional 90-foot rappel followed by an optional 70-foot rappel where the Navajo sandstone drops down to the Kayenta sandstone. These optional rappels can be skirted via the rock and scree slopes to the south. To bypass the optional rappels walk the south (left) bench about 1/4 mile down canyon to an obvious point where you can route find your way to the canyon bottom (N38° 17' 13\", W110° 24' 21\"). From the base of the walk around continue hiking down canyon for approximately 1 mile and you will be able to see a really sweet arch (N38° 16' 46\", W110° 25' 15\") on the south wall. From where you view the arch keep hiking an additional 1 mile down canyon to where Larry Canyon widens considerably. Keep your eyes open for a bowl-like side canyon on the south side that contains the Exit Crack (N38° 16' 27\", W110° 25' 59\"). The Exit Crack is clearly visible, as a light colored sandstone, from a considerable distance as you are hiking down canyon. You must climb this 4th class crack to the canyon rim. Big Horn Sheep often use the Exit Crack and there is an abundance of tracks at the base of the Exit Crack. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/larry.htm 1/25/2018 Larry Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 From the top of the Exit Crack climb the slickrock east to the base of a prominent buttress. Circle around to the north side of the buttress and scramble to the canyon rim using a ledge and crack system. Once on the canyon rim hike 100-yards east and intersect a dirt road and the Optional Shuttle Trailhead (N38° 16' 13\", W110° 25' 22\"). If you don't have a shuttle vehicle enjoy the tiresome 4 mile trudge back to the trailhead. Historical Information: Larry Canyon is said to be named for Larry Thompson, the first person to fence the canyon. Video: Enjoy a short video from Larry Canyon in Robbers Roost.

If so, Lost Park might be for you. This route explores several of the unnamed upper tributaries that form Horseshoe Canyon. General Information: Lost Park is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This slot canyon is a great adventure for intermediate canyoneers with solid natural anchoring skills. The route requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 6 to 7 hours. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. In normal conditions this canyon might require a couple of short sections of waist deep wading. Wetsuits are normally not required, but cold or wet conditions could alter the need. A GPS is extremely useful for this route. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Head Spur\" and \"Robbers Roost Flats\" are essential. Navigation for this route is more complex than your typical canyoneering route. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The longest rappel in Lost Park is 60-feet and requires a 120-foot rope. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100-feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the charm. Most problems in this canyon are easy to defeat using a little teamwork and ingenuity. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Your first destination will be the Han's Flat Ranger Station so you can easily follow the signs. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a second fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed East Fork (left fork) and follow the road 5.2 miles to the Lost Park Trailhead. The trailhead is identified by a faint and closed road heading northeast. Some refer to the closed road as the Goat Park Road. The trailhead is normally accessible to carefully driven passenger vehicles in good weather conditions. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/lostpark.htm 1/25/2018 Lost Park - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Route Information: From the Lost Park Trailhead (N38° 18' 28\", W110° 17' 29\"), hike cross-country in a southeast direction for approximately 3/4 miles, and then hike east for approximately 1 mile until you intersect the Lost Park drainage (N38° 18' 9\" W110° 15' 44\"). Hike downstream until the drainage develops into shallow narrows that will require downclimbing and mild stemming with a little water in wet conditions. After the first short section of narrows you will encounter a second section that will require mild stemming and down climbing to negotiate. Shortly after this second section of narrows the drainage you have been following will join the main fork of Lost Park Canyon (N38° 18' 31\", W110° 15' 29\"). Hike down canyon until you encounter a short slot with a 25-foot rappel from a pine tree on the west (left) side of the canyon. A little scramble will allow you to reach the rappel anchor. After rappelling you will downclimb into a pool that will always have knee to waist deep water. After exiting the large pool there are petroglyphs & cowboy-glyphs on the east (right) side of the canyon. This short little section can actually be bypassed, but you would be missing a lot of fun. Make note of the large open area just downstream from the large pool as you will be returning to it when you exit the canyon. From the large open area continue hiking downstream and you will soon reach the best segment of slot canyon. Easy stemming and downclimbing lead to a very nice section of twisty narrows that you can walk through. The end of the narrows are marked by a 60-foot rappel anchored from a large solid flake located in the watercourse. After the 60-foot rappel hike downstream and immediately turn east (right) down a fault- line canyon. You will want to be very observant of your surroundings as exiting this canyon can be confusing. Follow the fault-line canyon for less than 1/2 mile to where it meets Horseshoe Canyon. Approximately 200-yards before the junction with Horseshoe Canyon you will want to turn south (right). Route find your way up onto a bench and locate a minor side drainage (N38° 19' 13\" W110° 14' 49\"). This minor side drainage will not be apparent from the canyon bottom. Follow the minor side drainage northwest to the top, where you will find a flat bench. From the flat bench route find your way up and left on slick rock. As you climb, the canyon that you just descended will become visible on the right. Follow the canyon rim up Lost Park until the large open area (N38° 19' 06\" W110° 15' 13\"), located below the large pool you made note of earlier is viable. Route find your way down the very steep slickrock until you are at the bottom of the Lost Park drainage. The easiest route down will pass a USGS geological marker mid-way to the canyon floor. Once in Lost Park, hike back up canyon until just before the large pool with petroglyphs & cowboy-glyphs and locate a side drainage heading west (right). Climb west up the side drainage until your first possible exit (N38° 19' 08\" W110° 15' 23\") on the south (left) side. Hike up this minor side drainage scrambling and bushwhacking around dryfalls as required. At first the drainage is apparent, but as you keep hiking it fingers out. You will want to keep hiking to the southwest (right). After hiking up the minor side drainage for 1/2 mile (N38° 18' 51\" W110° 15' 45\"), you turn west (right) and route find your way to the canyon rim (N38° 18' 55\" W110° 15' 57\"). From the canyon rim, hike cross-country through juniper and grassland in a northwest direction for just over 1/2 mile until you intersect the closed to vehicles, Goat Park Road (N38° 19' 15\" W110° 16' 32\"). Follow the Goat Park Road southwest for 1 1/4 miles to the Lost Park Trailhead. Canyon Name: Why the name Lost Park? The canyon had no official name that I could find, but it drains an area of the Robbers Roost marked on the USGS maps as Lost Park.

While not a destination canyon it combines nicely with Larry Canyon or Alcatraz for those in the area looking for more meat and potato's to pile on their plate. General Information: Lost Spring Canyon is divided into three forks. The North Fork of Lost Spring Canyon is the best route and will be the focus of this route description. The Middle Fork of Lost Spring Canyon is mediocre at best and details are provided at the bottom of this route description for those that just have to do everything. The South Fork of Lost Spring Canyon is not worthy and is best described as \"we did it so you don't have to\". The North Fork of Lost Spring Canyon requires complete technical gear. Lost Spring Canyon is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. In normal conditions this canyon might require minor wading. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 2 to 4 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Angel Point\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Lost Spring Canyon use the WGS84 datum. The longest rappel in the canyon is 35-feet and requires an 80-foot rope. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the numerous drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchors and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #147 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South (right) Fork leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a signed fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed West (right) Fork towards Ekker Ranch. Follow the road for 6.8 miles to a fork (N38° 17' 54\", W110° 21' 14\"), The South (left) Fork leads to Ekker Rancher and is signed \"Private Property, No Trespassing\". Take the West (right) Fork and follow the road west for 0.5 miles to the Angel Point Junction (N38° 17' 48\", W110° 21' 45\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/lostspring.htm 1/25/2018 Lost Spring Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 To reach the Lost Spring Canyon Trailhead from Angel Point Junction turn west (right) towards Angel Point and continue for 1.1 miles until you cross a shallow wash. This is the Larry Canyon Trailhead (N38° 18' 17\", W110° 22' 44\"). From the Larry Canyon Trailhead continue following the road for an additional 1.5 miles to a faint 4x4 track (N38° 19' 23\", W110° 23' 36\") on the north (right) side of the road. A carefully driven passenger car in good weather can usually reach this point. However, the roads in this area are subject to the whims of the road grading crew so go prepared. Blowing sand and migrating sand dunes occasionally block the roads. Those without 4x4 will have to park here and walk the remainder of the distance to the trailhead. Those with 4x4 turn north on the faint 4x4 track and follow it for 1.5 miles to the North Fork of Lost Springs Trailhead. Route Information: From the North Fork of Lost Spring Canyon Trailhead (N38° 20' 33\", W110° 22' 50\") route find your way west, down to the bottom of the large slick rock bowl. Once in the bottom of the bowl you are immediately presented with a 35-foot dryfall. Instead of rappelling the dryfall traverse to the south (left) side of the canyon until you see a weakness that allows a walk down into the canyon bottom. You can scramble back up canyon to the bottom of the first dryfall if you like. Once in the canyon bottom hike downstream. Soon you will be stopped by a 35-foot rappel. The current anchor is a rectangular rock wedged between the canyon walls. This anchor will probably have to be rebuilt after every flash flood. Material to build natural anchors abound in this location. Shortly after the 35-foot rappel is a second rappel or very difficult down climb. The drop is 20-feet and the anchor is the large chokestone located in the drainage. Next up is a third rappel down a fluted dryfall. The rappel is 35-feet and is anchored from a large stone in the bottom of a pothole. After this the canyon opens up a little before dropping into a dark hole, which is a downclimb down a tight chimney. Shuffle sideways for a while climbing over and under chokestones and soon the canyon opens up. Hike down canyon until you locate a weakness (N38° 20' 38\", W110° 23' 36\") on the south (left) side of the canyon that allows access to the rim. Climb out of the canyon and hike back to the trailhead. Middle Fork of Lost Springs Canyon: The Middle Fork of Lost Spring Canyon does not require technical gear. The route is rated 2A II using the Canyon Rating System. In normal conditions this canyon might require minor wading. The trailhead for Middle Fork is located 0.4 miles south of the North Fork Trailhead on the faint 4x4 track. From the Middle Fork of Lost Spring Canyon Trailhead (N38° 20' 14\", W110° 22' 58\") hike west down the wash. The route is hot and sandy with some good downclimbing. 1 1/2 miles after leaving the trailhead you will intersect (N38° 20' 35\", W110° 24' 12\") the North Fork of Lost Springs. Hike up the North Fork and use the same weakness to escape that you used for the North Fork route.

This is an interesting adventure for intermediate canyoneers and beginners with skilled leadership who have the ability to ascend a rope. General Information: If long walks in the desert to visit unique features are not your cup of tea then I suggest you skip this adventure. Otherwise this route is suitable for beginners with good leadership. This route requires that all canyoneers have the ability to ascend a simple fixed rope. Low Spur is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon requires complete technical gear. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. This canyon is very remote. Please use caution when assessing risk and remember that mediocre medical care is at least 5 hours away. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 3 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Horsethief Canyon\", \"Bowknot Bend\" and \"Keg Knoll\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. In normal conditions this canyon is dry with some possible wading. The only rappel/jug in the canyon is 65-feet. A 70-foot rope is suggested for this route, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, and at least one pair of high quality ascenders for group use. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Your first destination will be the Han's Flat Ranger Station so you can easily follow the signs. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a second fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed East Fork (left fork) and follow the road 14.2 miles to the Hans Flat Ranger Station (N38° 15' 19\", W110° 10' 47\"). Things can get a little confusing at the Hans Flat Ranger Station because the area is a major junction of roads and there are two signs pointing to Horseshoe Canyon (two different trailheads). One sign points back the way you just came and one sign points north. You want to take the road north signed Horseshoe Canyon. You will know you are on the correct road if the ranger residence is to your immediate west (left) as you pull out of Hans Flat. This road access a section of Robbers Roost referred to as The Spur. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/lowspur.htm 1/25/2018 Low Spur - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 From Hans Flat Ranger Station follow the Spur road north for 12.8 miles to a road leading west (left) signed Deadman's Trail (N38° 24' 59\", W110° 8' 56\"). At this junction veer east (right) staying on the Spur road for an additional 1.6 miles to a junction (N38° 26' 05\" W110° 08' 46\") where you will veer east (right). Follow this road and additional 5.0 miles to where you will find a place to park on the west (left) side of the road. This is the Low Spur Trailhead. The roads in this area are subject to the whims of the local road grading crew so go prepared. The road is usually in good condition to the Han's Flat Ranger Station, The Spur Road is usually in good condition with several rough spots. Those with four wheel drive should never have a problem reaching the trailhead. A high clearance vehicle will have no problems reaching the trailhead in good weather. I would advise against attempting the road is a passenger vehicle. Route Information: From the Low Spur Trailhead (N38° 29' 39\" W110° 07' 05\"), hike northwest for 3/4 mile to the head of Low Spur (N38° 30' 06\" W110° 07' 28\"). Start hiking downstream and enjoy the open desert hike until you reach a point where the canyon drops away (N38° 30' 35\" W110° 08' 05\"). Rig a rope at the big chokestone and handline or rappel into the dark canyon below. Shortly after the rappel is a 6 to 8-foot drop which is easy to downclimb. Explore the large and unique subway cavern. After exploring, return the way you came. On the return the 6 to 8-foot drop requires 5.9+ to climb solo, but a partner assist from bottom or top reduces the requirement. If necessary you can build a cairn at the base to stand on and help with the climb back up. Use ascenders or handline back up the fixed rope. Retrieve your rope and exit east (left) skirting around the canyon you hiked down earlier and head back to the trailhead.

The canyon gained notoriety when it was dramatically mentioned in a popular guidebook. The technically challenging canyon is located in the western outlaw country once frequented by Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch. General Information: Mind Bender is a remarkable slot canyon with an assortment of downclimbing. This canyon requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon might require knee to waist deep wading. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 5 to 6 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Point of Rocks East\" and \"Angel Point\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate to difficult. Errors in navigation can have serious consequences. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Mind Bender is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The longest rappel in the canyon is 155 feet. Two 50 meter ropes are required for this route, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 75 to 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the numerous drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the charm. This canyon could become extremely difficult if there have been recent rains and all the potholes are full of water. The reason for this is most the natural anchors are built in dry potholes. If the potholes are filled with water you might required nearly every foot of webbing mentioned above. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk. The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/mindbender.htm 1/25/2018 Mind Bender - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a signed fork in the road. Take the signed West Fork (right fork) towards Ekker Ranch. 100 yards down the Ekker Ranch Road a major road Tee's in from the west (right). This road leads to the Robbers Roost Spring. Turn west (right) on the Robbers Roost Spring Road. Follow this road for 6.0 miles to a junction. The road to the south (left) leads to Robbers Roost Spring. Turn west (right) at the junction and follow the road for 2.3 miles to an old drill site that is easy to identify. This is the Mind Bender Trailhead. The trailhead can be used as a campground if there is no wind. It's not the best campground in the area but it is convenient. On the USGS maps the access road is shown about 100 yards north of its actual location. If you have two vehicles or mountain bikes a short shuttle can be set up that eliminates one mile of walking down a flat dirt road. To set up the shuttle just continue following the dirt road west for an additional 1.0 miles to the Moki Exit Trailhead. This trailhead is extremely easy to identify since the road ends at the edge of a huge cliff and provides outstanding views. A really fun campsite is available at the Moki Exit Trailhead provided the wind is not blowing. Those with four wheel drive should never have a problem reaching the trailhead. A carefully driven passenger car in good weather can usually reach the trailhead. However, the roads in this area are subject to the whims of the local road grading crew so go prepared. Blowing sand and migrating sand dunes occasionally block the roads. Route Information: From the Mind Bender Trailhead (N38° 21' 59\", W110° 24' 54\"), hike 1/2 mile northeast through the sandy desert and route find your way, over slickrock, to the bottom of the canyon (N38° 22' 17\", W110° 24' 18\"). Start hiking down canyon and let the fun begin. In a short distance you will come to the first rappel. The 35-foot rappel is anchored from a chokestone. 1/3 mile below the first rappel you will encounter a second rappel. The 20-foot rappel is anchored from a chokestone. The next major obstacle is an 8-foot downclimb with exposure to a ledge that leads to a chimney that can easily be downclimbed. Some may want to setup a rappel or handline to protect this drop. Those with good partner assist skill's should not have much of a problem downclimbing the section. The canyon will continue as an easy hike before it begins to constrict. As the canyon narrows up you will discover a few more downclimbing problems. The most difficult being a 10- foot drop that must be negotiated, the best method is to partner assist. The final rappel is 50 feet beyond the 10-foot drop. It might be wise to make sure you have the ability to construct an anchor before the last person downclimbs this section. The slot ends in a dramatic 155-foot free air rappel over a giant alcove. The rappel is anchored from a stack of rocks in a pothole. If it has rained recently and the pothole is full of water this could get really tricky. If the canyon has flashed recently you might be required to rebuild the anchor. Go prepared to deal with this rappel, which means a bunch of extra webbing. At the bottom of the final rappel you will find a small spring and pool surrounded by lush vegetation. Hike down canyon 1/4 mile to where a canyon enters from the north (N38° 22' 35\", W110° 25' 50\"). This canyon is often referred to as \"Not Mindbender\". Continue hiking down canyon for 1 mile and you will encounter a second junction (N38° 22' 19\", W110° 26' 32\") where North Fork of Robbers Roost joins from the north. This is an important landmark. From this junction you must hike down canyon 1/2 mile to the Moki Trail Exit. The Moki Trail Exit (N38° 22' 05\", W110° 26' 54\") is located on the south (left) side of the canyon. It is located at a break in the cliffs where a shallow side canyon enters. It is one of the the few places you will find that offers any hope of climbing out of the canyon. At first glance climbing out of any type does not look promising. Walk up onto the sandy bench until you can see a giant alcove. The Moki exit is located 150 feet west of the alcove. There is a hiker made trail leading to the base of the slickrock, you might notice some worn Moki Steps in the area http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/mindbender.htm 1/25/2018 Mind Bender - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 where the sand and slickrock meet. From below the exit looks scary but possible. It's not too bad and only one member of your party must climb it as the others can be belayed. The climbing is about 5.4 with some exposure. Scramble 20 feet up the slickrock to the steep 20-foot crux that has plenty of handholds. The holds are decent but could blow out with a large force, use caution. At the top of the Moki Exit you will notice a petroglyph panel of bighorn sheep just to the west if you look for it. From the top of the Moki Exit hike east across the top of the giant alcove on a 3-foot wide ledge and exit up the canyon that drains over the alcove. Continue hiking east until you encounter a large sandstone buttress. Pass to the south of the buttress and climb the steep rock slide straight ahead to the canyon rim. From the canyon rim hike north 1/4 mile and intersect the dirt road (N38° 22' 06\", W110° 26' 06\") and the Moki Exit Trailhead. Follow the dirt road east for 1 mile to the Mind Bender Trailhead. What's In A Name: How did Mind Bender get it's name? The following excerpt is from Steve Allen's excellent guidebook 'Canyoneering 2: Technical Loop Hikes in Southern Utah'. \"By the time we reached the crux section of the canyon, we had been enveloped by a blizzard; the snow that whipped through the canyon stung our eyes and froze our hands. The crux was truly a mind bender; the narrow slot gave way to an abrupt drop over the 155-foot-high mouth of a huge cave. We spent an hour rigging our ropes. With no secure anchor points, we ended up burying a sling under a pile of rocks at the bottom of a large pothole and attaching the rope to it.\" \"I went first, carefully sliding out of the slot and into a vertical void, the floor of the canyon invisible in the swirl of snow. Would the rope be long enough? The question was answered when I was halfway down: the rope was long enough but my trajectory would have taken me through the limbs of an oak tree and into a large pool. Not good! With some gentle swinging I managed to hit a dry landing zone. Ginger took her time lowering packs over the fifteen-story drop. From below I saw that the brunt of the storm had descended on her. The rock was now plastered with rime ice and, perilously perched on the edge of the abyss, every move on her part had to be carefully executed. A mistake could have meant the ultimate splat. At long last I saw Ginger's legs emerge from the slot; she slowly spun down the rope, afraid a sudden jerk would dislodge it from its precarious anchor. There were no further obstacles below. The Mind Bender Fork was a done deal.\" [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Shane Burrows http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/mindbender.htm 1/25/2018 Moonshine Wash - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 1 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Moonshine Wash Robbers Roost Canyoneering Moonshine Wash is a fun semi-technical slot canyon in the Robbers Roost area. The canyon contains an abundance of history and artifacts from the early 1900's. The canyon was named after the illegal whiskey still that was located in the canyon during prohibition. The signature of the canyon is an interesting old Sheep Bridge spanning the tightest spot of the narrows. The route visits two sections of slot canyon, the old whiskey still, moonshine spring and the old Sheep Bridge from above and below. The route contains several hiking options to accommodate different skill levels. The trailhead described allows you to drive to the beginning of the slot canyon and eliminates several miles of slogging presented in other guidebooks. General Information: Moonshine Wash is a semi-technical canyoneering adventure. Every group should have at least one experienced hiker or rock climber along to help defeat a few minor obstacles. This route will require 5 to 6 hours to complete the full meal deal. Shorter route options are also presented. This route can be completed in either direction. You will need an 80-foot rope for hand lines, belays, lowering packs and possible emergency use. Moonshine Wash may contain short sections of knee deep wading in normal conditions. With a little care and ingenuity it should be possible to keep your shoes dry. This route is accessible year round but you are warned that it is difficult with snow on the ground and it would be extremely hot in summer. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Moonshine Wash\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. The route involves several miles of cross-country navigation. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Moonshine Wash is rated 2A III using the Canyon Rating System. Check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to this route. Trailhead Information: The trailhead is accessible in good weather to all vehicles. Those with 4x4 can drive nearly all the way to the beginning of the slot canyon. Those with passenger cars and high clearance vehicles will be forced to stop when they feel the road is becoming difficult. From the heart of Green River, Utah locate where Center Street crosses Main Street. The intersection is signed \"Airport\", you will be following the signs pointing to the airport. Drive south on Center Street for 0.3 miles until the road Tee's into \"Green River Avenue\". Turn east on Green River Avenue and drive 150-yards to \"Airport Road\", turn south on Airport Road and follow it for 2.3 miles to a dirt road turn-off signed San Rafael Desert/Horseshoe Canyon. The Robbers Roost area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn-off of it. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/moonshine.htm 1/25/2018 Moonshine Wash - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 From the signed turn-off follow the well-maintained dirt road south for 19.2 miles to where a bridge crosses the San Rafael River. From the bridge over the San Rafael River continue following the main dirt road south for an additional 5.4 miles. At this point you will encounter a 4x4 track that crosses the main road (N38° 41' 14\", W110° 09' 16\"). The track is signed \"Designated Off-Road Route\" with a brown BLM marker on the east side of the main road. Passenger cars will be force to park here. 4x4 and high clearance vehicles should turn west on the 4x4 track. The 4x4 track is well carined with large markers. Follow the 4x4 track west for 0.3 miles to a Y-intersection (N38° 41' 21\", W110° 09' 35\"). The Right Fork leads to a campsite near the rocks. Take the Left Fork and follow it an additional 0.6 miles to the Moonshine Trailhead (N38° 41' 04\", W110° 10' 11\"). The trailhead is identified with a turn around area where the 4x4 track begins to enter a wash. All 4x4's should be able to reach this trailhead with little problem. It is possible to drive all the way to the beginning of the Moonshine Wash slot but the route from this point on becomes a true 4x4 route. ATV's commonly use this route to access the beginning of the slot canyon. There are several nice primitive campsites along the 4x4 track. Optional Trailhead Information: It is also possible to reach Moonshine Canyon from the Horseshoe Canyon Trailhead. These two canyons together would be an enjoyable two-day combination. From the Horseshoe Canyon Trailhead drive north for 1.7 miles to a Tee. Turn east and follow the main road as it swings north for 12.8 miles to an intersection in Saucer Basin. From the Saucer Basin intersection, continue following the main road north toward Green River for an additional 1.8 miles to the beginning of the 4x4 track noted above. Route Information: From the Moonshine Trailhead (N38° 41' 04\", W110° 10' 11\"), follow the 4x4 track west as it descends the side wash to join up with Moonshine Wash. The route from the trailhead to the beginning of the slot in Moonshine is 3/4 miles. The 4x4 track ends right at the beginning of the slot (N38° 40' 59\", W110° 10' 47\"). Climb down into the slot and enjoy your trip down through the narrows. You will encounter several scrambling problems, which should not be difficult with a little partner assist. The actual slot is about 3/4 miles long. Near the end of the slot if you look up you will notice an old Sheep Bridge spanning the canyon. This is quite an impressive sight. Just after passing under the Sheep Bridge the canyon begins to open up. Keep hiking down canyon and enjoy the scenery. 3/4 miles after passing under the Sheep Bridge you will encounter an Escape Route out the west side of the canyon that leads to the rim (N38° 41' 52\", W110° 10' 50\"). It's a good idea to locate this route and keep it in mind. If you can not do the next section of canyon you might want to use this route. 1/3 mile after the Escape Route you will encounter a junction with a large slot canyon entering from the west. This is the West Fork of Moonshine Wash (N38° 42' 06\", W110° 10' 38\"). Turn west at this junction and begin climbing up the West Fork into the slot. Just past the junction you will encounter a 40-foot pour-off that will probably have a trickle of water running down it. You must climb up this pour-off. The exposure is very minimal and a fall will most likely only result in some lost skin and damaged pride. This is the most difficult obstacle on the route. If you can not climb the pour-off you will be forced to retrace your path and exit by climbing back up Moonshine Wash or using the previously noted escape route. From the top of the pour-off the slot continues and you will encounter a couple more bouldering problems that are easy to surmount if you look around for the easiest route and use some partner assist skills. 1/3 mile from the West Fork/Main Fork junction you will encounter a 10-foot high waterfall with a cement vat below. This is the old whiskey still. 100-yards up canyon from the waterfall you will encounter a junction with a side drainage entering from the north (N38° 42' 04\", W110° 11' 02\"). This side drainage leads to Moonshine Spring (N38° 42' 08\", W110° 11' 21\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/moonshine.htm 1/25/2018 Moonshine Wash - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 It is 1/4 mile up the side drainage to Moonshine Spring. As you near the spring the side drainage you are following forks. Take the west fork. It's easy to identify since it is the fork with vegetation growing in it. The spring is about 150-yards past the fork. The fork ends in a large alcove. From the spring return to where the side drainage junctions into the West Fork. Continue hiking up the West Fork for 1 1/4 miles to a junction (N38° 41' 21\", W110° 11' 36\"). Take the West Fork. It will appear that the fork you have chosen ends but it snakes behind a cliff in an interesting fashion. From the junction continue hiking up canyon for an additional 1/2 mile. The canyon will threaten to slot up but never quite does it. As you near the head of the canyon you will be forced to climb over a couple of short dryfalls. The last of these dryfalls marks the exit point from the wash (N38° 40' 59\", W110° 11' 53\"). From this point you have several options. For those without a GPS, I suggest you point your compass east and begin hiking. You will meet up with Moonshine Wash at the spot where you first dropped into the slot. For those with a GPS you will want to visit the Sheep Bridge from the top. This really adds little in the way of hiking and is well worth the fun. From the exit of West Fork you will want to head northeast. After 1/2 mile if you are good at navigating with your GPS you will encounter at 1911 survey marker (N38° 41' 14\", W110° 11' 21\"). Navigating to this marker will give you practice with your GPS and helps add excitement into the stroll over the slickrock. From the survey marker head east for 3/4 miles to the Sheep Bridge (N38° 41' 20\", W110° 10' 40\"). Visiting the Sheep Bridge from the top is amusing. I would not visit this site with children because of the cliffs involved. After visiting the Sheep Bridge just follow the canyon rim back to where you first dropped into the slot canyon. Just above the Sheep Bridge is a bench that you can easily walk back to the start of the canyon. At one point it will appear that you are going to be cliffed out but there is a nice 3-foot wide, easy to identify, route across the cliffs. Once at the 4x4 track just follow it back to your vehicle. History: Moonshine Wash received its name from a whiskey still located in the West Fork. Bill Tomlinson built the still during prohibition. The still consisted of a large concrete vat with several tubs located 20-yards below a 10-foot waterfall. The moonshiner's would build a small damn above the waterfall and pipe water down to the vats. The vat and some of the piping is still in the canyon and easy to locate. Moonshine was often the only way settlers in the area could earn cash during the depression years. Many of the canyons in the Robbers Roost/San Rafael Swell area contained a still during this era. A picture looking up at the old Sheep Bridge from the bottom of the slot canyon has become the signature photograph of the canyon. At one time there were several similar Sheep Bridges over slot canyons in the Robbers Roost/San Rafael Swell area but this is the last one remaining that I am aware of. The bridge is in frail condition and could tumble into the slot at any time. Getting sheep to cross this bridge must have taken an ingenious application of force. I tried desperately to get my canyoneering partner to stand in the middle of the bridge so I could take his picture but no amount of ingeniously applied force would get him to do it. Optional Routes: For those who just want to visit the slot canyon you can hike down to the Sheep Bridge and back out of the canyon in 2 to 3 hours. It is possible to hike down through the slot and use the Escape Route to visit the top of the Sheep Bridge on your return trek along the rim. This route would take about 3 or 4 hours. This route is probably the easiest of all the routes mentioned. © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/moonshine.htm 1/25/2018 No Mans Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] No Mans Canyon Robbers Roost Technical Canyoneering No Mans Canyon is a great technical slot canyon with some charming swirling sandstone narrows. The route is buried deep in the heart of Robbers Roost of famous western outlaw lore. General Information: No Mans Canyon is a remarkable slot canyon requiring complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 4 to 5 hours. No Mans Canyon is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This is a good route for intermediate or advanced canyoneers, the route has a couple obstacles that will be problematic for beginners. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. In normal conditions this canyon might require knee to waist deep wading, swimming is seldom required. There are several minor stemming problems and a couple of potholes that could present problems in the wrong water conditions to those not properly prepared or versed in pothole escape techniques. The longest rappel in the canyon is 100-feet and requires a 60-meter ropes. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 75 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is useful in verifying you are on the correct route. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Angel Point\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for No Mans Canyon use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #147 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South (right) Fork leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a signed fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed West (right) Fork towards Ekker Ranch. Follow the road for 6.8 miles to a fork (N38° 17' 54\", W110° 21' 14\"), The South (left) Fork leads to Ekker Rancher and is signed \"Private Property, No Trespassing\". Take the West (right) Fork and follow the road west for 0.5 miles to the Angel Point Junction (N38° 17' 48\", W110° 21' 45\"). To reach No Mans Canyon Trailhead from Angel Point Junction turn west (right) towards Angel Point and continue for 3.3 miles to where a small spur road (N38° 19' 13\", W110° 24' 10\") branches off to the south (left). Follow the small spur road south for 0.2 miles to the No mans Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify as it offers a commanding view of No Mans Canyon. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/nomans.htm 1/25/2018 No Mans Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 A high clearance vehicle is required for accessing this trailhead, a four-wheel drive is usually not required. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Route Information: From the No Mans Trailhead (N38° 19' 06\", W110° 24' 08\"), follow the hiker trail 1/4 mile and circle around to the south side of the canyon to where a little side canyon (N38° 18' 53\", W110° 24' 20\") and a sandy slope will allow walk-down access to the bottom of the North Fork of No Mans Canyon. Head downstream and let the fun begin. The canyon slowly gets deeper with a few minor obstacles to defeat. Soon enough you will reach the first rappel, which is 25-feet and anchored from a chokestone. After the rappel the canyon alternates between slot and open, the slot sections contain obstacles to vanquish. Upon reaching the final section of slot you will be presented with a 25-foot rappel anchored from a chokestone. A few pothole escape problems are present in the last slot section. None are too difficult to escape although changing conditions could alter that. The final obstacle in the technical section is a two-stage drop. This drop is normally broken into two rappels of 50-feet and 100-feet of mostly free hanging. The final 100-foot rappel will require at least 20-feet of webbing to properly rig an anchor. At the bottom of the final rappel you will find a nice pool and thriving vegetation. From the final rappel hike downstream for 3/4 mile, past a side canyon entering from the south (left), to where an old cattle trail climbs the south (left) wall (N38° 18' 54\", W110° 26' 22\"). The old cattle trail contains rock work forming a path to allow cattle to enter and exit the canyon. The cattle trail will lead you to the top of the first cliff Band. Upon reaching the top of the first cliff band hike in an east-southeast direction to the base of slickrock mounds that run in a southeast to northeast direction (N38° 18' 47\", W110° 26' 00\"). At the base of the slickrock mounds turn and hike northeast to reach benches on the west side of a high ridge that is just north of a distinctive pinnacle. You should target the saddle between the pinnacle and the high ridge. Once into the saddle skirt around the high ridge to the north, climbing up and down the benches as required to avoid being 'cliffed-out'. This route will place you just to the south of the slot canyon you descend earlier and just to the north of the high ridge on your right. With a little luck you will find an emerging hiker trail and cairns showing the path of least resistance around the high ridge. Upon reaching the southeast side of the high ridge (N38° 18' 58\", W110° 25' 13\"), Climb up toward the summit of the high ridge to avoid exposed climbing. Once you are near the top of the high ridge a route to the east, through a saddle, and continuing up to the top of the cap rock will become obvious. Upon reaching the top of the cap rock follow the canyon rim east back to the trailhead. Related Links: No Mans Tragedy - The heartbreaking story of Louis and David Cicotello in No Mans Canyon.

It's because a group of friends looking for the actual Mind Bender stumbled upon this little beauty first and did a descent. What the group had actually found was Mind Benders big brother. This canyon is proof that size does matter. This canyon might not have a cool name but it does have all the beauty and attractions of it's more famous little brother. This canyon is nearly a mirror of Mind Bender but everything is on a larger scale. The canyon is longer, the narrows are deeper and the slot is tighter. General Information: Not Mindbender is an outstanding slot canyon with an assortment of downclimbing. The canyon requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions the canyon might require knee to waist deep wading. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Several routes are presented both with and without a required vehicle shuttle. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 hours. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Point of Rocks East\", \"Angel Point\", \"Whitbeck Knoll\" and \"Robbers Roost Flats\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate to difficult. Errors in navigation can have serious consequences. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Not Mindbender is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The longest rappel in the canyon is 90 feet. One 60 meter rope is required for this route, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 75 to 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the numerous drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. This canyon could become difficult if there has been recent rains and all the potholes are full of water. The reason for this is most the natural anchors are built in dry potholes. If the potholes are filled with water you might required every foot of webbing mentioned above. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road. This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk. The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/notmindbender.htm 1/25/2018 Not Mindbender - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a signed fork in the road. Take the signed West Fork (right fork) towards Ekker Ranch. 100 yards down the Ekker Ranch Road a major road Tee's in from the west (right). This road leads to the Robbers Roost Spring. Turn west (right) on the Robbers Roost Spring Road. Follow this road for 4.6 miles. This is the Standard Not Mindbender Trailhead. It is identified by the fact that the road is heading north and makes a near 180° turn to the south. The Standard Trailhead is easy to identify and there is a wide place to park on the north side of the road. From the Standard Trailhead you must set up a shuttle. From the Standard Not Mindbender Trailhead continue to follow the Robbers Roost Spring Road south for an additional 1.4 miles to a junction. The road to the south (left) leads to Robbers Roost Spring. Turn west (right) at the junction and follow the road for 0.7 miles to the Optional Not Mindbender Trailhead. The Optional Trailhead is identified as a point where the road makes a hard left and heads back west. The Optional Trailhead is easy to identify and there is a wide place to park on the north side of the road. The Optional Trailhead provides a really easy 15 minute mountain bike shuttle or and extra 1 1/2 hours of hiking. From the Optional Trailhead continue following the road west for 2.9 miles to the Moki Exit Trailhead. This trailhead is extremely easy to identify since the road ends at the edge of a huge cliff and provides outstanding views. A really fun campsite is available at the Moki Exit Trailhead provided the wind is not blowing. Those with four wheel drive should never have a problem reaching the trailhead. A carefully driven passenger car in good weather can usually reach the trailhead. However, the roads in this area are subject to the whims of the local road grading crew so go prepared. Blowing sand and migrating sand dunes occasionally block the roads. Route Information: From the Not Mindbender Trailhead (N38° 22' 31\", W110° 21' 25\") you are instantly presented with a choice. Do you want to descend the North Prong or the South Prong of Not Mindbender. Both provide a short, easy and fun section of slot canyon. Both prongs are about equal but different in what you will get. Pick your Poison. North Prong: For the North Prong of Not Mindbender hike just a little over one mile northwest to the bottom of the North Prong Drainage (N38° 23' 10\", W110° 22' 17\"). Once you are in the drainage begin following it west and let the fun begin. The upper slot is mild and exciting. The North Prong joins the South Prong 1 1/2 miles downstream. South Prong: For the South Prong of Not Mindbender hike one mile west-northwest to the bottom of the South Prong Drainage (N38° 22' 47\", W110° 22' 22\"). Once you are in the drainage begin following it west and let the excitement begin. The upper slot is easy and fun. The South Prong joins the North Prong 1 1/2 miles downstream. From the junction of the North and South Prongs (N38° 23' 09\", W110° 23' 34\") just keep heading west. The canyon continues to get better and better the further and deeper you go. You will encounter 2 or 3 rappels depending upon your downclimbing and partner assist skill's. You will also encounter some very mild mae west stuff but nothing that should trap large frame canyoneers. You can always stay high to avoid the skinny stuff. After about 2 miles of one of the best slot canyons in existence you will finally reach the \"Great Falls\", which is the end of the actual slot. The Great Falls are very impressive as the narrow slot ends 90 feet above a beautiful spring fed alcove. The rappel down the Great Falls is normally anchored by two bolts, however these bolts occasionally disappear as causalities of the never ending bolt war. If the bolts have been removed setting an anchor becomes a little tricky. To keep this simple I will tell you that with a long piece of webbing you can reach back up and http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/notmindbender.htm 1/25/2018 Not Mindbender - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 over the often water filled potholes to a chokestone. If the potholes are empty you can easily build a deadman in their sandy bottoms. From the bottom of the Great Falls hike down canyon for 1/2 mile to where a canyon that enters from the southeast (N38° 22' 35\", W110° 25' 50\"). This canyon is known as \"Mind Bender\". Continue hiking down canyon for 1 mile and you will encounter a second junction (N38° 22' 19\", W110° 26' 32\") where North Fork of Robbers Roost joins from the north. This is an important landmark. From this junction you must hike down canyon 1/2 mile to the Moki Trail Exit. The Moki Trail Exit (N38° 22' 05\", W110° 26' 54\") is located on the south (left) side of the canyon. It is located at a break in the cliffs where a shallow side canyon enters. It is one of the the few places you will find that offers any hope of climbing out of the canyon. At first glance climbing out of any type does not look promising. Walk up onto the sandy bench until you can see a giant alcove. The Moki Exit is located 150 feet west of the alcove. There is a hiker made trail leading to the base of the slickrock, you might notice some worn Moki Steps in the area where the sand and slickrock meet. From below the exit looks scary but possible. It's not too bad and only one member of your party must climb it as the others can be belayed. The climbing is about 5.4 with some exposure. Scramble 20 feet up the slickrock to the steep 20-foot crux that has plenty of handholds. The holds are decent but could blow out with a large force, use caution. This north facing exit becomes impossible with any snow on the ground. At the top of the Moki Exit you will notice a petroglyph panel of bighorn sheep just to the west if you look for it. From the top of the Moki Exit hike east across the top of the giant alcove on a 3-foot wide ledge and exit up the canyon that drains over the alcove. Continue hiking east until you encounter a large sandstone buttress. Pass to the south of the buttress and climb the steep rock slide straight ahead to the canyon rim. From the canyon rim hike north 1/4 mile and intersect the dirt road (N38° 22' 06\", W110° 26' 06\") and Moki Exit Trailhead. Optional Not Mindbender Trailhead: The Optional Not Mindbender Trailhead is for those without a vehicle shuttle. A bicycle shuttle works extremely well for the 3 mile cruise from the Moki Exit Trailhead. The road between trailheads is virtually flat. Or you can just hike between trailheads if you add an extra hour to your route. You will not miss any slot canyon using this option but you will be limited to the South Prong. From the Optional Not Mindbender Trailhead (N38° 21' 56\", W110° 22' 59\") simply hike 1 1/4 miles north to a point where you interest the South Prong (N38° 23' 01\", W110° 23' 03\"). You will interest the canyon just before it begins to slot up. You must cross the upper forks of Mind bender when using this option. Make certain you do not screw up your navigation and descend Mind Bender or you might not have enough rope at the finial rappel.

If so, Red Spur might be for you. This canyon is spicy enough to challenge intermediate canyoneers and reward their effort with magnificence splendor. Red Spur is located in one of the most remote and impressive regions in the lower 48 states that was once ruled over by the notorious Wild Bunch. General Information: Red Spur is rated 3A III R using the Canyon Rating System. This slot canyon is very photogenic and provides numerous opportunity for taking outstanding pictures. The route requires complete technical gear. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 7 hours. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. In normal conditions this canyon might require a couple of short sections of waist deep wading. The canyon has the ability to hold a large amount of water and will likely contain swimming immediately after a storm. Wetsuits are normally not required, but cold or wet conditions could alter the need. Red Spur is a challenging slot canyon suitable for intermediate or advanced canyoneers. A couple of obstacles along the route make this canyon a poor choice for novice without competent and skilled leadership. This canyon is very remote and drains a section of Robbers Roost known as the High Spur. Please use caution when assessing risk and remember that mediocre medical care is at least 5 hours away. This route requires pothole escapes, stemming, rappelling from hooks and mild squeezing. Large frame canyoneers should not have a problem with this route as all squeezing obstacles can be climbed over. There are several escape opportunities along this route. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Head Spur\" and \"Sugarloaf Butte\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. Red Spur contains at least two mandatory rappels. Depending on your skills you might encounter additional rappels. The longest mandatory rappel in the canyon is 35-feet and requires two 50-foot ropes, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50-feet of webbing, several rapid links, a prusik system, at least one potshot and at least one Black Diamond Cliffhanger or Grappling Hook. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the charm. Most problems in this canyon are easy to defeat using a little teamwork and ingenuity. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/redspur.htm 1/25/2018 Red Spur - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Your first destination will be the Han's Flat Ranger Station so you can easily follow the signs. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a second fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed East Fork (left fork) and follow the road 14.2 miles to the Hans Flat Ranger Station (N38° 15' 19\", W110° 10' 47\"). Things can get a little confusing at the Hans Flat Ranger Station because the area is a major junction of roads and there are two signs pointing to Horseshoe Canyon (two different trailheads). One sign points back the way you just came and one sign points north. You want to take the road north signed Horseshoe Canyon. You will know you are on the correct road if the ranger residence and solar panels are to your immediate west (left) as you pull out of Hans Flat. This road access a section of Robbers Roost referred to as The Spur. From Hans Flat Ranger Station follow The Spur road north for 9.3 miles to the Red Spur Trailhead. The trailhead is identified by a faint 4x4 track on the west (left) side of the road heading northwest. The faint 4x4 track begins next to a large juniper tree. The faint 4x4 track still shows up on most old maps but the track was closed by the National Park Service several years ago and can be difficult to locate in places. The roads in this area are subject to the whims of the local road grading crew so go prepared. The road is usually in good condition to the Han's Flat Ranger Station, The Spur Road is usually in good condition with several rough spots. Those with four wheel drive should never have a problem reaching the trailhead. A high clearance vehicle will have no problems reaching the trailhead in good weather. I would advise against attempting the road is a passenger vehicle. There is no camping at the immediate trailhead because you are inside the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. If you want to locate a primitive campsite in the area you must continue north an additional 3.0 miles on the Spur Road until you exit the National Recreation Area. Route Information: From the Red Spur Trailhead (N38° 22' 22\", W110° 08' 06\"), follow the faint 4x4 track northwest for 1 1/2 miles to the top of a small hill (N38° 23' 14\", W110° 08' 57\") offering a nice view of the surrounding area. At the top of the small hill leave the 4x4 track and hike southwest following a slowing developing drainage for 3/4 miles to where the slot begins in the North Fork of Red Spur (N38° 22' 54\", W110° 09' 31\"). Climb to the bottom of the slot and let the fun begin. Hike downstream enjoying a couple of downclimbs, a short slide, a pothole that can be jumped or stemmed, which is immediately followed by a 35-foot rappel. This rappel is a little tricky and is anchored by a hook. If you are not comfortable rappelling from a hook please find anther route appropriate with your skill level. Locate the solid hook placement on the south (left) side of the canyon. The biggest problem with this rappel is that the hook placement is so solid you can not get your hooks to release by flipping the rope after you complete your rappel. Test your method of hook release before you rappel. There is very little anchor building material in this area and if the potholes have water there will be little sand and no place to dig available. Following is how we did rigged this rappel, you are free to devise other anchoring methods such as a sand trap or possible deadman. Bolting this rappel is not an option and any bolts found will be removed so go prepared. To retrieve our hook we tied one 50-foot rope to the hook to rappel from. We clipped a quick-link to the handles of a potshot. We placed the potshot filled http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/redspur.htm 1/25/2018 Red Spur - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 with sand 3-feet behind (up canyon from) the hook. We tie the second 50-foot rope to the backside of the hook, ran the rope backwards, through the quick-link attached to the potshot, and than back over the edge to act as our pull chord. After the last man rappelled we tugged on the pull chord, which pulled the hook from its placement, snagged on the quick-link attached to the potshot, and allow us to pull the entire setup down. After the 35-foot rappel continue downstream and enjoy the downclimbing, stemming and squeezing. The canyon will open up and than constrict again for more downclimbing, stemming and a couple of potholes before it reaches the confluence with South Fork of Red Spur (N38° 22' 46\", W110° 10' 08\"). From the confluence continue downstream and enter what is known as the \"Twisty Narrows\", this section is mostly downclimbing and mild squeezing through a fun section of twisty slot canyon with the occasional obstacle to defeat. This section of canyon normally has good lighting for photography. The canyon opens up and then constricts at your second and final rappel. This rappel is 35- feet and is anchored by a chokestone. If the anchor has washed out this rappel is no problem as there is plenty of material to build a solid anchor in this area. The rappel drops you into the last section of slot canyon known as the \"Deep Narrows\", continue downstream and enjoy the slot as it becomes deep and dark, this is the best section of narrows. If there is water to swim or wade in the canyon it will be found in this section of slot. All of the semi-keeper potholes in this section can be defeated by stemming, bridging or using a pack toss. None of these potholes should turn you into bone soup so long as you possess basic pothole escape techniques in your arsenal of skills. Soon the adventure of the Deep Narrows ends and a short 100-yard stroll brings you to the Big Pour-off (N38° 23' 02\", W110° 10' 54\"), typical of most Robbers Roost area canyons. From the top of the Big Pour-off you want to hike northeast and aim for the canyon rim. Reaching the rim will require some easy route finding and 1 mile of hiking as you snake your way through the sandstone layers and across several minor drainages. Once you reach the canyon rim you want to locate the faint 4x4 track (N38° 23' 20\", W110° 10' 05\") you were walking on earlier in the day. Locating this track makes the hike out much easier. Once you locate the faint 4x4 track follow it east for 2 1/2 miles to the Red Spur Trailhead. South Fork Option: Adding the South Fork option will add about one hour to your overall time. The South Fork option is not for large frame canyoneers as some tight squeezing is involved with the route. The South Fork option is the hardest part of this route and should be avoided by mediocre and novice canyoneers. The South Fork contains about 200-feet of high stemming approximately 30- feet off the deck. You have been warned! From the confluence of North Fork and South Fork of Red Spur you can hike up South Fork for 1/2 mile to a point where you can see a large sandstone buttress on the north (left) side of the canyon (N38° 22' 40\", W110° 10' 13\") with several large alcoves high on the canyon wall. You will want to route find your way around and over until you locate a walk down on the backside that deposits you in the bottom of South Fork (N38° 22' 26\", W110° 10' 03\"). Once in the bottom of South Fork you can scramble up canyon and visit a section of narrows until stopped by a dryfall, above the dryfall the canyon opens up. After visiting the upper section of narrows hike downstream and you will encounter a second section of narrows that requires some downclimbing, squeezing and stemming before reaching the confluence of North and South Fork. Canyon Name: Why the name Red Spur? The canyon had no official name that I could find, its a tributary of Spur Canyon, and it drains an area known as the High Spur. In addition, much of the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/redspur.htm 1/25/2018 Red Spur - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 4 of 4 sandstone has a really deep red color and because the 90-degree June heat beat us like a red- headed step child on the hike out.

Like any grand old gentlemen the canyons charms are refined, graceful and astute. General Information: The North Fork of Robbers Roost is a distinguished slot canyon. The canyon is not difficult in comparison to most technical Canyons. The problems are straight forward and easy to solve. Probably the most difficult part of the route is the Crack Exit, which most will consider an enjoyable scramble. The North Fork of Robbers Roost requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon might require minor knee to waist deep wading. Keeping your shoes dry can usually be accomplished with minimal effort. The canyon is accessible year round but summer would not be pleasant. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 5 to 6 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Point of Rocks East\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for The North Fork of Robbers Roost use the WGS84 datum. The North Fork of Robbers Roost is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The longest rappel in the canyon is 50 feet. The route requires a 100-foot rope. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 15.4 miles to an intersection at the top of a hill (N38° 29' 58\", W110° 24' 52\"). This is known locally as \"Texas Hill\" and a ranch is visible just to the south of the intersection. From the intersection turn south (right) and follow the dirt road past the ranch buildings, and through a gate. Please be friendly and drive slowly through the ranch compound. From the Texas Hill intersection follow the dirt road south for 5.5 miles to a small dirt road on the east (left) side. This is the North Fork Access Road (N38° 25' 47\", W110° 24' 57\"). Passenger vehicles will be forced to park here. High clearance Vehicles (HCV) and 4x4's need to turn east on the North Fork Access Road, pass through the gate, and follow the road for http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/rrnf.htm 1/25/2018 Robbers Roost, North Fork Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 0.8 miles to the bottom of the Upper White Roost Valley. This is the North Fork of Robbers Roost Trailhead. Just pull off the road and park in one of the wide grassy areas. There is no decent camping in the area of the trailhead. Route Information: From the North Fork of Robbers Roost Trailhead (N38° 25' 27\", W110° 24' 30\") hike 1 1/4 miles east on the North Fork Access Road to where the road descends to the bottom of the North Fork of Robbers Roost (N38° 25' 13\", W110° 23' 25\"). The canyon is just a big wash at this point. Hike south down the bottom of the wash and enjoy the scenery. Its a gratifying stroll if you get an early start and the temperatures are mild. Hike down the watercourse for 1 1/4 miles to the first major obstacle (N38° 24' 31\", W110° 24' 10\"). This is a 30-foot rappel from a slung boulder, or a moderate downclimb with some exposure. This is also where the real fun begins. Just keep following the watercourse downstream and enjoy the show. Many of the obstacles can be easily defeated with a little partner assist. The second rappel is 25-feet from a slung chokestone. Keep your rope out, the second rappel is followed almost immediately by the 3rd rappel. The third rappel is 50-feet and anchored by a bolt and piton. Don't be surprised if these are removed in the near future, the Robbers Roost is considered a bolt free zone. If the bolts are removed it should be simple to construct a natural anchor. Below the third rappel you will enter a deep dark slot that is mostly a walk through. No major squeezing is involved and the canyon is wide enough to allow big guys to pass easily through. This section of the canyon is very beautiful. The canyon will open up and then pinch back down for the grand finale. This section is even deeper and darker then the previous slot and provides some great photo opportunities. This section ends in the fourth and final rappel. The fourth rappel is 35-feet and is currently anchored by two bolts. Below the fourth rappel the North Fork begins to widen and is joined by a major drainage from the east (left). This drainage is sometimes referred to as Ho Hum Canyon (N38° 23' 45\", W110° 24' 35\"). In this section of the canyon you will usually find a trickle of a stream from the usual Roost type spring. 200-yards below Ho Hum what looks like an easy exit joins from the west (right). This is the False Exit (N38° 23' 42\", W110° 24' 43\"), do not attempt to escape here, its an inferior exit requiring some dicey climbing on poor quality rock. 250-yards below the False Exit you will encounter the Crack Exit (N38° 23' 40\", W110° 24' 54\") entering from the west (right). At first this does not look like a very promising escape. When standing in the North Fork of Robbers Roost this looks like a narrow slot canyon joining the main drainage. Even as you begin to hike up the Crack Exit it doesn't look encouraging. 1/4 mile after leaving the main drainage you will come to what at first appears to be a dead end. But a careful look will reveal good handholds that will allow you to climb the 10-foot crux of the route. The route is no harder then 5.4 with a partner assist to get things going. Once over the crux you will be presented with anther dozen minor obstacle to surmount until you pop out the top of the Crack Exit (N38° 23' 59\", W110° 24' 49\"). From the top of the Crack Exit you will notice a use trail starting to develop. Follow the use trail 1/2 mile north. If your route finding is good you will intersect a fence where it meets an old 4x4 track. Locating the fence/4x4 track junction (N38° 24' 26\", W110° 24' 55\") is a big help. Hiking north up the old 4x4 track makes the route much easier. From the fence it is 1 1/4 mile back to the Trailhead. Ho Hum Canyon: So Ho Hum Canyon looks really good from the bottom and you want to check it out? The canyon is not one of the best options in the area but here is the beta if you want to descend it. Ho Hum is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. Plan on 7 to 8 hours trailhead to trailhead. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Point of Rocks East\" and \"Whitbeck Knoll\" are required for this route. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/rrnf.htm 1/25/2018 Robbers Roost, North Fork Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 From the standard entrance to the North Fork of Robbers Roost you hike an additional 1 1/4 miles following the North Fork Access Road. The road is hard to follow where it crosses the North Fork of Robbers Roost. Follow the road to where it nears Ho Hum Canyon (N38° 24' 32\", W110° 22' 19\") and route find to the bottom of the wash. Next simply follow the Ho Hum watercourse. The canyon contains three short rappels, the longest rappel is 60-feet and will require a 120-foot rope. Follow Ho Hum until it intersects the North Fork of Robbers Roost.

This deep and beautiful canyon is located in a remote wilderness. A small intermittent stream and occasional pools add to the interesting route. There are no major difficulties with this adventure and the canyon can be enjoyed by beginning technical canyoneers. Some of the photographs on this page were provided by Michael Holland and Ryan Cornia. General Information: Three Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon consists of a two-stage, 100 foot rappel to begin the route and a zesty climbing finish. In between the entrance rappel and the climbing exit are several miles of deep, charming, and photogenic canyon. No deep wading or swimming is required for this route. An intermittent stream runs through the canyon, but it can be easily stepped across as needed. There are, however, deep pools that may be a great diversion on a hot day. This is not a difficult route for a technical canyon, and would make an excellent weekend when combined with nearby Moonshine Wash. Three Canyon requires complete technical gear. A 60-meter rope is required for the two- stage entrance rappel and a 40-foot rope is required to fix the exit crack with an optional handline (highly recommended for first timers). Several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. Total time required from Upper Trailhead to Lower Trailhead is 5 to 6 hours if exploring all options and using a shuttle vehicle. This route involves 3 1/4 miles of road walking if a shuttle is not used. The route is perfectly suited for the use of a bicycle as your shuttle. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Moonshine Wash\" and \"Tenmile Point\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Three Canyon is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. Trailhead Information: The trailhead is accessible in good weather to all vehicles. Those with 4x4 can drive nearly all the way to the beginning of the slot canyon. Those with passenger cars might be force to hike an extra 1/4 mile. From the heart of Green River, Utah locate where Center Street crosses Main Street. The intersection is signed \"Airport\", you will be following the signs pointing to the airport. Drive south on Center Street for 0.3 miles until the road Tee's into \"Green River Avenue\". Turn east on Green River Avenue and drive 150-yards to \"Airport Road\", turn south on Airport Road and follow it for 2.3 miles to a dirt road turn-off signed San Rafael Desert/Horseshoe Canyon. The Robbers Roost area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn-off of it. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/three.htm 1/25/2018 Three Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 From the signed turn-off follow the well-maintained dirt road south for 19.2 miles to where a bridge crosses the San Rafael River. From the bridge over the San Rafael River continue following the main dirt road south for an additional 3.5 miles. At this point you will encounter a 4x4 track (N38° 42' 40\", W110° 08' 46\") on the east (left) side of the road that heads east. The track is signed \"Designated Off-Road Route\" with a brown BLM marker. Passenger cars may be forced to park here. The track is somewhat vague, and goes up a small hill. Follow this road approximately 0.3 miles to where you are overlooking the three canyon area. This is the Lower Trailhead (N38° 42' 37\", W110° 08' 41\"). The Lower Trailhead is where you leave your shuttle vehicle. While at the Lower Trailhead you are encourage to fix a 40-foot handline to assist in escaping the canyon. Fixing the Exit Crack will required 15 to 30 minutes. To fix the Exit Crack, hike south to the north rim of the spur canyon. Follow the north rim until you are across from a corner and by an alcove on the north side. The exit is just up canyon from the alcove. You will be able to descend steep slick rock until you find a crack and corner with an antique \"rancher bolt\", made from a piece of farm machinery embedded in the sandstone. You can fix your rope to the antique rancher bolt (N38° 42' 22\", W110° 08' 25\"). The bolt is over 60 years old and probably qualifies for some type of relic status. To reach the Upper Trailhead return to the well-maintained dirt road. Drive south on the well-maintained dirt road an additional 3.3 miles (6.8 from the San Rafael River Bridge) to the Upper Trailhead (N38° 40' 07\", W110° 09' 43\"). The Upper Trailhead has no distinguishing landmarks and it doesn't really matter if you miss it a little either side, all roads lead to Rome. Simply find a place to pull off the road and park Route Information: From the Upper Trailhead (N38° 40' 08\", W110° 09' 43\"), simply hike southeast, using the path of least resistance and drop into Three Canyon. The first rappel is located at (W38° 40' 00\", N110° 09' 21\" W). Up canyon from the rappel are some interesting short narrow sections. Nothing particularly deep or narrow, but feel free to explore. The first and only rappel is a 100-foot, two-stage affair that is anchored from a bolt. The first stage is a short rappel into a pothole, which you exit and rappel into a second pothole on the canyon floor. The upper pothole is usually dry. The lower pothole might require some wading. For the skilled who might be attempting to avoid water on a cold day you can swing right (LDC) about 15 feet above the bottom of the rappel, and exit on some ledges. Once in the canyon bottom, it's impossible to get lost, simply head down canyon. You will follow a small stream that grows in flow as you get lower in the canyon. It is a relatively wide and charming canyon. Step across the stream as needed. At a couple of points, there are brief sections of bush whacking, but they never last long. The Exit Canyon (N38° 42' 15\", W110° 08' 15\") is located 3 miles below the entrance rappel and is the first major canyon that comes in at stream level from the north (left). As you start up the exit canyon, look for a social path on the left that you can use to get around the first dryfall. The second dryfall is passed on the right. Shortly after the second dryfall, look for an alcove on the right. The Exit Crack (N38° 42' 22\", W110° 08' 25\") is just up canyon from the alcove and is recognizable by a corner/crack towards the top. Climb up to the corner/crack. To surmount this section, you can either slab climb to the left of the corner using a couple of old moki steps, or you can ascend the corner directly, again using some old moki steps. Both routes are short (10 feet) and rated approximately 5.6 with some exposure. If you fixed the recommended handline before beginning the exit should present no problem. From the top of the Exit Crack, continue climbing up out of the canyon. You should see the Lower Trailhead and your shuttle vehicle to the northwest. Optional Route #1: From the mouth of the Exit Canyon, you can continue down canyon 1/4 mile to where an http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/three.htm 1/25/2018 Three Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 interesting Side Canyon (N38° 42' 17\", W110° 08' 02\") enters from the north (left). This Side Canyon is fun to explore and ends at a dryfall about 1/2 mile up stream. From the mouth of the Side Canyon you can continue down stream for 3/4 miles to the Green River (N38° 42' 23\", W110° 07' 21\"). Optional Route #2: The Exit Crack Canyon can be descend from the very top by technical canyoneers. It requires two rappels of less then 60-feet. The Side Canyon can be descended from the very top by technical canyoneers and is a really good route. You will encounter one 4th class downclimb and then a 80-foot rappel from a chockstone. There are two possible waist to cheat deep pools above the rappel and a short section of tight narrows. You can do a fun loop of down the Side Canyon and out the Exit Crack. The loop will require 3 or 4 hours and a 50 meter rope.

This route description cherry picks the best part of Tidwell Canyon. The route detailed requires that all canyoneers have the ability to ascend fixed ropes. General Information: Tidwell Canyon is for intermediate to advanced canyoneers only. This route requires that all canyoneers have the ability to ascend fixed ropes. One of the ascending problems is extremely physical and awkward because of the canyon geometry. This is not a route for beginners or a place to learn ascending skills. You have been warned! Tidwell Canyon is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This route requires complete technical gear. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. This canyon is very remote. Please use caution when assessing risk and remember that mediocre medical care is at least 5 hours away. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 4 to 6 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Sugarloaf Butte\" and \"Keg Knoll\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. In normal conditions this canyon is dry with some possible wading. The longest rappel/jug in the canyon is 35-feet, but because of the requirement to fix ropes and the location of natural anchors two 60-foot ropes are suggested for this route, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and at least one pair of high quality ascenders for group use. Note: If you plan to descend this slot canyon all the way to Horseshoe Canyon you will need two 200-foot ropes. Doing so would create a really long loop with a lot of hiking and sand slogging. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Your first destination will be the Han's Flat Ranger Station so you can easily follow the signs. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a second fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed East Fork (left fork) and follow the road 14.2 miles to the Hans Flat Ranger Station (N38° 15' 19\", W110° 10' 47\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/tidwell.htm 1/25/2018 Tidwell Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Things can get a little confusing at the Hans Flat Ranger Station because the area is a major junction of roads and there are two signs pointing to Horseshoe Canyon (two different trailheads). One sign points back the way you just came and one sign points north. You want to take the road north signed Horseshoe Canyon. You will know you are on the correct road if the ranger residence is to your immediate west (left) as you pull out of Hans Flat. This road access a section of Robbers Roost referred to as The Spur. From Hans Flat Ranger Station follow the Spur road north for 12.8 miles to a road leading west (left) signed Deadman's Trail (N38° 24' 59\", W110° 8' 56\"). At this junction veer east (right) staying on the Spur road for an additional 1.6 miles to a junction (N38° 26' 05\" W110° 08' 46\") where you will veer west (left). Follow this road for 1.9 miles to where the road will veer west (left) down a steep 4x4 track (N38° 27' 28\" W110° 08' 49\") that is very sandy in places. It's possible to park and camp at the top of the 4x4 track. To reach the actual trailhead continue down the 4x4 track an additional 1.2 miles to an old drill hole site. This is the Tidwell Canyon and Water Canyon Trailhead. The best camp spot in the area is at the trailhead (old drill hole). The roads in this area are subject to the whims of the local road grading crew so go prepared. The road is usually in good condition to the Han's Flat Ranger Station, The Spur Road is usually in good condition with several rough spots. Those with four wheel drive can reach the actual trailhead. A high clearance vehicle should allow you to reach the camp spot at the top of the sandy 4x4 track. I would advise against attempting the road is a passenger vehicle. Route Information: From the Tidwell Canyon Trailhead (N38° 28' 02\" W110° 09' 38\"), hike northeast cross- country for 1 3/4 miles to West Fork of Tidwell Canyon (N38° 29' 15\" W110° 08' 53\"). Route find your way into the bottom of the West Fork and enjoy a few downclimbing problems. Soon you will reach a junction with the Main Fork of Tidwell joining from the east (right). Relish the canyon as it develops. Soon the canyon starts to get narrow and then drops. A chokestone located 10 to 15-feet from the first drop provides the most secure anchor to fix a rope. The rappel itself is 15-feet. The start of the rappel is tight so you must chimney out on rappel, the rappel then Bombay's as you begin to slide down, as you swing into the tight part of the slot watch your head. If you have any doubt about not being able to ascend this drop on your return do not go any further. A second option for this drop is to locate an old piton, which will make everything easier. The piton is located directly about the first rappel. It’s further out on the rock down- canyon, so it’s where the crack is wider. It’s about eye level when standing above the rappel, and maybe six feet down canyon from the lip. This piton makes the rappel in and the jug back out a little easier. Immediately down canyon from the first rappel is the second rappel, which is 35-feet. Sling one of the many chokestones, fix a rope, and rappel into a deep dark canyon. The canyon below this drop is deep and a nice casual walk with some occasional downclimbing, nice hallways and twisting narrows. This is a very breathtaking and dark section of canyon. You might encounter a pool to wade after recent rains. Eventually the canyons bottom drops out and there is a small place to sit and enjoy the view. After this return the way you came. On your return the first jug (second rappel) is very straight forward. The second jug (first rappel) can be difficult. If you rigged a rope to the old piton things are pretty straight forward. If you rigged your rope to the chokestones you might need to boost a canyoneers feet from the bottom for a little help escaping, but keep in mind your physical ascending will be only as high as the anchor. In other words your anchor is in the canyon bottom above, so you can only jug to that point. Since the canyon is narrow at the lip, you must start climbing several feet away from the lip to fit your body through, you will have no help from your feet and maybe some marginal help from a partner assist from below. Your ascenders should provide protection if you fall out, but be prepared for a swing should you fall. The taller the spotter from below the better as they will be able to push you higher. When your first canyoneer surmounts the obstacle it is possible to create a human anchor 20-feet up and direct the jug out 18\" from the pour-over which will make it a little easier for your next canyoneer. The human http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/tidwell.htm 1/25/2018 Tidwell Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 anchor position isn't the most comfortable and is slightly exposed. Be sure of your position before committing. After jugging out return the way you came hiking back to the trailhead.

The canyon is located in the heart of outlaw country once frequented by the notorious Wild Bunch. General Information: Water Canyon is a picturesque slot canyon with an assortment of opportunities. This canyon requires complete technical gear. This is a excellent canyon for intermediate canyoneers with good natural anchor skills. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. In normal conditions this canyon might require some minor wading. This canyon is in a very remote section of Robber's Roost. Please use caution when assessing risk and remember that mediocre medical care is at least 5 hours away. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 8 to 10 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Sugarloaf Butte\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Water Canyon is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The longest rappel in the canyon is 85-feet. A 60 meter rope is required for this route, additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Keeper Pothole: This route contains a keeper pothole and every group should devise a strategy for defeating the keeper pothole beforehand. If your group has at least one competent canyoneer that is at least 6 feet tall the keeper is a non-issue as it's easy for tall canyoneers to stem across. Escaping the pothole from within is difficult. You have been warned! Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Your first destination will be the Han's Flat Ranger Station so you can easily follow the signs. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 24.3 miles until you come to a signed fork in the road with an information kiosk (N38° 28' 21\", W110° 16' 50\"). The East Fork (straight ahead) leads to Horseshoe Canyon, the South Fork (right fork) leads to the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Take the South Fork and follow the road for 7.1 miles to a second fork in the road (N38° 22' 39\", W110° 18' 19\"). Take the signed East Fork (left fork) and follow the road 14.2 miles to the Hans Flat Ranger Station (N38° 15' 19\", W110° 10' 47\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/roostwater.htm 1/25/2018 Water Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Things can get a little confusing at the Hans Flat Ranger Station because the area is a major junction of roads and there are two signs pointing to Horseshoe Canyon (two different trailheads). One sign points back the way you just came and one sign points north. You want to take the road north signed Horseshoe Canyon. You will know you are on the correct road if the ranger residence is to your immediate west (left) as you pull out of Hans Flat. This road access a section of Robbers Roost referred to as The Spur. From Hans Flat Ranger Station follow the Spur road north for 12.8 miles to a road leading west (left) signed Deadman's Trail (N38° 24' 59\", W110° 8' 56\"). At this junction veer east (right) staying on the Spur road for an additional 1.6 miles to a junction (N38° 26' 05\" W110° 08' 46\") where you will veer west (left). Follow this road for 1.9 miles to where the road will veer west (left) down a steep 4x4 track (N38° 27' 28\" W110° 08' 49\") that is very sandy in places. It's possible to park and camp at the top of the 4x4 track. To reach the actual trailhead continue down the 4x4 track an additional 1.2 miles to an old drill hole site. This is the Water Canyon and Tidwell Canyon Trailhead. The best camp spot in the area is at the trailhead (old drill hole). The roads in this area are subject to the whims of the local road grading crew so go prepared. The road is usually in good condition to the Han's Flat Ranger Station, The Spur Road is usually in good condition with several rough spots. Those with four wheel drive can reach the actual trailhead. A high clearance vehicle should allow you to reach the camp spot at the top of the sandy 4x4 track. I would advise against attempting the road is a passenger vehicle. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Route Information: From the Water Canyon Trailhead (N38° 28' 01\", W110° 09' 38\") hike south-southwest for 1 1/2 miles to the head of Water Canyon (N38° 26' 46\" W110° 10' 10\"), which begins as a shallow slot. Hike downstream until you are stopped by a dryfall and 35-foot rappel. The rappel anchor is a cedar tree on north (right) side of the canyon. After the rappel head downstream until you encounter a 12-foot downclimb. Immediately after the downclimb is a 50-foot rappel. The anchor for this rappel is a deadman in the watercourse. If there is no rappel anchor or anchor building material at the top of this rappel you might be forced to farm rocks from below to build a solid anchor. After the rappel the canyon is an open walk until it slots up again and provides some downclimbing and a couple of pools. The canyon will open up again before slotting up into a fantastic section of slot canyon. The canyon becomes narrow and tight, enjoy its beauty. Canyoneer through this section encountering a tough downclimb or 10-foot rappel anchored from a chokestone. Shortly after the downclimb is a rappel from two bolts on the south (left) canyon wall. The rappel deposits you in a keeper pothole, if you rappel to the bottom, but the pothole can be stemmed across while on rappel which allows you to easily continue down a second low-angle rappel into a second pothole. From here continue down into the dark canyon enjoying the amazing section of slot canyon. Shortly after the amazing section of slot canyon the southeast fork of Water Canyon joins from the south (left) and the canyon drops into a narrow slot. There are two sandstone hats located downstream high on the canyon wall that are a unique feature. Locate a small tree on the south (left) side of the canyon that provides an anchor for the next rappel which is 35-feet high. You will need at least 25-feet of webbing to rig this anchor correctly and provide a good rope pull. Continue downstream until the bottom drops out of the canyon. The rappel is 85-feet and mostly free hanging. Continue hiking downstream to the confluence with Horseshoe Canyon at the Horseshoe Gallery (N38° 27' 45\" W110° 11' 58\"), which is my favorite rock art in Horseshoe Canyon. The Horseshoe Gallery is located on the west wall of Horseshoe Canyon. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/roostwater.htm 1/25/2018 Water Canyon - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 At this point you have the option of hiking upstream (southwest) 1 1/2 miles to visit the Alcove Gallery (N38° 27' 22\" W110° 12' 21\") and Great Gallery (N38° 26' 49\" W110° 12' 47\") and returning to the Horseshoe Gallery. The Great Gallery detour will add two hours to your route, but if you never been its worth the side excursion. From Horseshoe Gallery hike downstream (northwest) and you will locate the High Gallery (N38° 27' 41\" W110° 11' 54\") almost immediately high on the east (right) canyon wall. From the High Gallery hike downstream 1/2 mile to where the old Phillips Oil Company Road crosses Horseshoe Canyon (N38° 27' 58\" W110° 11' 41\"). The normal Horseshoe Canyon hiker trail climbs west (left) out of the bottom of Horseshoe Canyon. But you want to turn east (right) and follow the road as it climbs steeply out of the bottom of Horseshoe Canyon. Follow the road east for 2 1/4 miles back to the trailhead. If you happen to have two four-wheel drives you can set up a shuttle that eliminates the last 2 miles of this hike. Optional Route Information: Water Canyon can be completed using the normal Horseshoe Canyon West Rim Trailhead used by most hikers to visit the rock art in Horseshoe Canyon.

The stories I had heard were all over the board. Some called it a gentle canyon while others told of stemming, swimming and squeezing. What we uncovered was a fun slot canyon that can be many contrary things to different people. General Information: The White Roost is a conflicting slot canyon. The canyon is not difficult for moderately experienced canyoneers, but it is not a place to take beginners. The main problem for beginners is all the rappels begin in extremely awkward positions and in tight quarters where assistance from a more experienced partner is extremely difficult to administer. You will experience some basic stemming and squeezing in this slot but body girth should never be an issue with regards to fitting through this slot. For the moderately skilled the problems inside the canyon are straight forward and easy to solve. The White Roost requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon will require minor waist to chest deep wading. Staying dry is next to impossible at the last pool in normal conditions, but can usually be accomplished in the rest of the canyon with effort. Wet suits are not usually worn, but warm clothes to put on after the final pool are advisable. The canyon is accessible year round but mid summer would not be pleasant. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 4 to 5 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Point of Rocks East\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for White Roost use the WGS84 datum. White Roost is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. The longest rappel in the canyon is 45 feet. The route requires a 100-foot rope. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Trailhead Information: From Green River, Utah take I-70 westbound for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south from I-70 for 25 miles to mile maker 135.5 (1/2 mile south of the turn- off to Goblin Valley State Park). The well-maintained dirt road on the east side of highway 24 is signed Rooster Flats and Hans Flat Ranger Station, turn east onto this dirt road (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 34' 16\"). This area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. Follow the well-maintained dirt road east for 15.4 miles to an intersection at the top of a hill (N38° 29' 58\", W110° 24' 52\"). This is known locally as \"Texas Hill\" and a ranch is visible just to the south of the intersection. From the intersection turn south (right) and follow the dirt road past the ranch buildings, and through a gate. Please be friendly and drive slowly through the ranch compound. From the Texas Hill intersection follow the dirt road south for 8.2 miles to a junction (N38° 24' 23\", W110° 27' 06\"). The main road leads west (right). Turn south (left) and http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/wroost.htm 1/25/2018 White Roost - Robbers Roost - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 follow the smaller dirt road south for 0.8 miles to the White Roost Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify by a large pull-out that will accommodate a dozen vehicles. Carefully driven passenger vehicles can usually access this trailhead in dry weather. You can camp at the trailhead, which is the only reasonable campsite to be found in the area. Because of the lack of campsites you might be forced to share this area with other groups, so please play nice. Anyone camping at the trailhead is probably a fellow canyoneer. Route Information: From the White Roost Trailhead (N38° 23' 49\", W110° 27' 33\") hike 1 mile east cross- country and intersect the Main Fork of White Roost Canyon (N38° 24' 00\", W110° 26' 32\"). The main drainage is easy to identify as it is deep and wide where you intersect it. Scramble down to the bottom of the main drainage and begin hiking downstream. At first you will be hiking in the bottom of a large sandy wash, after approximately 1/2 mile the canyon begins to constrict and you will encounter several downclimbing and minor stemming problems. These problems are just difficult enough to add a little spice to the canyon. You might encounter some minor wading through this section of canyon. Next the canyon widens and allows a nice stroll downstream before tightening back up for the finish. The finish of the technical section is probably the most picturesque section of canyon. The canyon drops quickly into a deep and narrow slot. This section of canyon contains four rappels, a couple of which can be downclimbed by the skilled. The longest rappel is the final rappel and is 45-feet. The first two rappels can easily be rigged from one of several chokestones. The third rappel is the trickiest to rig. The rappel begins at the edge of a small pothole that usually holds knee deep water. The anchor for this rappel is a small arch in the canyon floor. The arch is located approximately 15-feet back from the lip and around the corner. You will need about 25- feet of webbing to properly rig this rappel anchor. The final rappel is again rigged from one of several chokestones and usually deposits you into a chest deep pool of water. Beyond the final pool the canyon immediately opens up. After exiting the technical section of canyon continue hiking downstream approximately 1/2 mile and you will reach the confluence of West Fork of White Roost (N38° 22' 53\", W110° 27' 23\"). From the confluence continue hiking down canyon for an additional 1/2 mile. Pay careful attention to the west wall and you will notice what first appears to be a slot canyon entering the main drainage. This is the Horse Trail Exit (N38° 22' 33\", W110° 27' 41\"). It is easy to miss if you are not paying attention. Hike up the Horse Trail Exit. If it is too difficult you are doing a lousy job of route finding. Remember, they used to get horses up and down this trail. Once you reach the top of the Horse Trail Exit it's a simple hike west to intersect the White Roost Road (N38° 23' 07\", W110° 28' 08\"). If you locate a shuttle vehicle here before you begin you can save yourself about 20 minutes and 1 mile of road walking. Either way, it's back up to the White Roost Trailhead. West Fork of White Roost: So you finished the Main Fork of White Roost and are looking for a little more adventure to add to your day? West Fork of White Roost is more of the same, but slightly shorter. You will need a 50-meter rope for the West Fork as the longest rappel is 75-feet. From the White Roost Trailhead hike 1/3 mile southeast and you should intersect the West Fork drainage. Just hike downstream and let the fun begin. Strong canyoneers should have no problem completing both the Main Fork and West Fork in the same day. Exit is the same as for the Main Fork. The West Fork of White Roost is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System.

Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: The Ascending Sheep Pictograph Panel has become a must visit to rock art enthusiasts. The site is accessible year round, but spring and fall are the preferred seasons. The hike to Ascending Sheep is 3/4 mile each way with 280-feet of elevation gain. The time required to visit the Ascending Sheep Pictograph, combined with The Snake, The Dinosaur Track and The Juggler is about half-a-day. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route and in locating the rock art. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Short Canyon\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This route is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: This Ascending Sheep Trailhead is accessible via a paved road to all vehicles in all weather conditions. From Ferron, Utah: From Center and Main Street in Ferron, Utah. Turn south on State Street (UT-10) and follow it for 5.1 miles. Turn left (east) onto County Road 801 and follow it for 2.0 miles. Continue (left) onto County Road 802 and follow it for 1.7 miles. Turn left (east) onto County Road 803 and follow it for 2.4 miles (mile marker 5.5) and find a place to pull safely off the road. This is the Ascending Sheep Trailhead. From Emery, Utah: From Center and Main Street in Emery, Utah. Turn east on Main Street (UT-10) and follow it for 3.5 miles. Turn right (east) onto County Road 801 and follow it for 2.7 miles. Turn right (east) onto County Road 803 and follow it for 2.9 miles (mile marker 5.5) and find a place to pull safely off the road. This is the Ascending Sheep Trailhead. Route Information: There are several ways to access the Ascending Sheep Panel, the way presented is the shortest and requires the least amount of time. From the Ascending Sheep Trailhead (N38° 57' 05\", W111° 07' 12\") just start hiking cross-country to the east. There is nothing difficult other than you will cross a couple of minor drainages. From the trailhead it is 3/4 mile to the Ascending Sheep Pictograph Panel (N38° 56' 53\", W111° 06' 36\"). The south facing panel is clearly visible from the ATV track that runs below it. This is an outstanding panel of native American rock art. The panel is not very large, but it contains an remarkable amount of detail. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/ascendingsheep.htm 1/25/2018 Ascending Sheep Pictograph - San Rafael Swell Page 2 of 2 The central figure is anthropomorphic, but it has a bighorn sheep’s head with a snake’s tongue, surrounded by numerous small bighorn sheep. The Snake Petroglyph: From The Ascending Sheep Trailhead follow County Road 801 southeast for 1.0 miles (mile marker 6.6) to a parking lot on the north (left) side of the road. From the parking lot explore the obvious boulders 20-yards to the northwest to locate The Snake Petroglyph (N38° 56' 25\", W111° 06' 42\"). After viewing The Snake look around and enjoy the numerous other hidden treasures. The Dinosaur Trackway (N38° 56' 26\", W111° 06' 35\") is located 35-yards northeast of the parking area. The trackway consists of approximately 10 tracks on a large boulder. The tracks are casts (positive reliefs) that were made by a single sauropod. The Juggler Petroglyph: From The Snake parking lot follow County Road 801 east for 1.0 miles (mile marker 7.6) to an access gate on the north (left) side of the road. From the access gate hike 150-yards north to The Juggler Petroglyph (N38° 56' 46\", W111° 05' 32\"). Please respect the rock art and dinosaur trackway, which are protected by the U.S. Archeological Resources Protection Act and the Antiquities Act respectively.

Cable Canyon San Rafael Swell Technical Canyoneering Cable Canyon is a great slot canyon that packs a very large punch as it traverses through the striking sandstone. Those attempting the route will get their moneys worth. Swimming, wading, scrambling, downclimbing and sliding down ropes are all part of the package. General Information: Cable Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon consists of wading, swimming, rappelling, downclimbing, pothole thrashing and plenty of fun. Total time required for a round trip is 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 hours. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. This route is suggested for experienced canyoneers only. The route contains a couple of keeper potholes, which require a variety of techniques to escape. We found all potholes escapable with coordinated teamwork or use of a pack toss. Changing water conditions or inexperienced team members could alter this fact. The water in the San Rafael Swell is usually bathtub warm if the weather has been hot. However, I suggest shorty wet suits as a minimum because you will be in the water and shade for several hours. If the weather has been cold, more protection will be required in the form of full wet suits or dry suit. The amount of fun to be had in this canyon is highly water dependant. The more water in the canyon the more fun you will have. In normal conditions this canyon holds a large amount of water. Several sections of swimming and long sections of wading are required. I recommend a minimum group size of three because of the partner assisted obstacles you will encounter. Team work and partner assisted techniques are used extensively in this canyon so go prepared. Cable Canyon requires complete technical gear. The longest rappel in the canyon is 70- feet, but a 60 meter rope is suggested. This allows you to eliminate several difficult to anchor rappels by combining the drops into one long rappel. Additional gear should consist of, several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 75 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. An Ibis hook and etriers might also be useful. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. The problem solving involved with using natural anchor and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. A GPS is very useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Hunt Draw\" and \"Factory Butte\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate to difficult. The route involves navigation and route finding through rock bands. All waypoints and maps for Cable Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Cable Canyon is rated 4B III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a high flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/cable.htm 1/25/2018 Cable Canyon - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Trailhead Information: From Hanksville, Utah follow Highway 24 west for 10.5 miles to mile marker 105.7. The Factory Butte road is located on the north side of Highway 24 and is signed \"6650 East\". The road is graded and well maintained for the first 10 miles. From Highway 24 turn north and follow the Factory Butte road for 9.5 miles to a fork in the main road. Take the left fork and travel 1.0 mile to a tee in the road. Turn west (left) and continue for 1.9 miles to where the road meets Salt Wash. This is the trailhead. Any high clearance vehicle during good weather can access this trailhead. Passenger cars can easily access all but the last two miles of road. Beyond that point it depends on when the road was last graded by the county road crew. The final 3 miles of the access road is impassible and turns to deep mud when wet. This includes 4 wheel drive, you have been warned, its a long walk to get help. There are several descent campsites along the access road near Factory Butte. These campsites are exposed to the wind with no shade, but are free from bugs and mosquitoes. The are numerous campsites along Salt Wash just past the trailhead, but the bugs and mosquitoes can be atrocious during certain times of the year, particularly late spring. Route Information: From the Cable Canyon Trailhead (N38° 29' 48\", W110° 56' 41\") look west and identify the obvious weakness in the outer reef. This is your first destination. Hike west, cross Salt Wash, battle your way through a section of tamarisk, and hike through the weakness in the outer reef. Follow the dry wash west. 1/2 mile from the trailhead you will notice a lone cottonwood tree (N38° 29' 47\", W110° 57' 06\") solemnly guarding the entrance to Cable Canyon. Keep following the dry wash as it enters the reef. From the lone cottonwood tree you need to hike up the dry wash for 1 mile to the escape drainage. Along the way you will hike past a small side drainage entering from the south (left), up a really interesting sandstone ramp, and eventually encounter a second side drainage entering from the west (left) that is referred to as the escape drainage (N38° 29' 57\", W110° 57' 53\"). The base of the escape drainage is blocked by a dryfall but a weakness just to the north (right) splits the lower cliff band and allows you to escape the bottom of Cable Canyon. After gaining the canyon rim hike northwest, up the Moroni Slopes, for 1 3/4 miles. Its almost impossible to get lost, just keep Cable Canyon on your right, but not to close or the hiking gets difficult. Eventually you will reach an obvious bottleneck (N38° 30' 42\", W110° 59' 36\") formed by a canyon squeezing in from the west (left). Cross the bottleneck ridge and follow a sheep trail as it circles east (right) under the cliff band. This will deposit you on a large finger sticking out into Cable Canyon (N38° 30' 49\", W110° 59' 33\"). From the finger you can scramble south, down into the small gully. Skillful route finding will allow you to reach the gully floor without a rope. All others might be forced to setup a short rappel. After you reach the gully floor it is a simple scramble down to the bottom of Cable Canyon (N38° 30' 43\", W110° 59' 23\"). Once you reach the floor of Cable Canyon you can explore up canyon as far as you wish. There are no dryfalls to block your path, but you will have to swim or wade several pools and scramble over several chokestones. This might require some partner assist skills. After exploring up canyon its game time. Begin hiking down canyon and you will soon reach the first rappel, which is 30-feet and anchored from a chokestone. The rappel will deposit you in a pool of water. After the rappel its a lengthy walk to the start of the first pothole section. The first pothole section consists of 6 water filled potholes in rapid-fire succession. The rappel anchor is from a chokestone above the first pothole. The second pothole in the series is a serious keeper pothole and the biggest obstacle on the route. The pothole is approximately 10- http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/cable.htm 1/25/2018 Cable Canyon - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 feet deep and can be defeated with a pack toss. Do not pull your rope until all members of your party can safely escape the third pothole in the series. The remaining three potholes are easily dispatched. Keep hiking down canyon and the next major obstacle you will encounter is the second pothole section. The second pothole section consists of 5 water filled potholes in swift succession. A 25-foot rappel is required to get down into the bottom of the first pothole in the series. The anchor is kind of tricky to locate if you don't know where to look. The anchor is located 30-feet behind the pothole and about 10-feet up on the west (right) side of the canyon. The anchor consists of a small natural arch and is easy to reach. After reaching the bottom of the first pothole in the series you should be able to swim and downclimb your way through the remaining potholes. The last major obstacle is what some call the \"Big Rappel\". The actual rappel is only about 50-feet but it is the biggest rappel on the route and it is very interesting. You will understand what interesting means when you get there. The anchor is a large chokestone approximately 15-feet up canyon from the lip of the rappel. This anchor usually requires 40-feet of webbing to properly rig for easy rope pull, so go prepared. The Big Rappel deposits you in a big pothole filled with water and mud, swim to the far side and use your rope to rappel 10-feet into the next water filled pothole. From the base of the Big Rappel there is no other obstacle that should cause you any problem. You will likely encounter some more downclimbing,wading and maybe swimming. Hike down canyon, over a splendid ramp,and back to the trailhead.

] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Drilling Derrick San Rafael Swell Exploring the Past If you like to view interesting items for the past this is for you. This old drilling and/or pumping derrick was constructed and powered by an old automobile. The derrick can be reached by 4x4 or a very easy hike. General Information: The Old Drilling Derrick is an interesting diversion for those looking to spend an hour or so admiring some very creative construction and operation of machinery. Those with a real 4x4 can drive right to the drilling derrick. Those with high clearance vehicles will have to walk approximately the last mile along an easy to follow 4x4 route. This is a fun diversion the entire family can enjoy. Navigation for this route is easy. Mistakes in navigation are easy to overcome and correct. A GPS is a complete waste of time but the waypoint for the derrick is N38° 44' 21\", W110° 31' 39\" for those of you who are electronic geeks. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Old Woman Wash\" is the map of reference. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. If you watch the center of the dirt road carefully about 25 yards before you reach the derrick you will note an abandoned drill hole of some type. The shaft is about 8\" round and extremely deep. If anyone has more information or knowledge on exactly what this derrick is and what it was used for I would be interested in hearing your thoughts and ideas. Please remember to take only pictures and leave only footprints. Trailhead Information: The old drilling derrick is located in Emery County between the towns of Green River and Hanksville. From Green River, Utah follow I-70 west for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south for 19 miles to mile marker #141.7. Turn west on the good dirt road. Cross through the gate and close it behind you. Follow the dirt road west for 0.9 miles to a fork. Take the north (right) fork and follow the road for 1.9 miles to a second fork. The west (left) fork leads to the Ernie Canyon Trailhead. Take the north (right) and follow the 4x4 road for 1.2 miles to the old mining derrick (N38° 44' 21\", W110° 31' 39\"). Those without 4x4 will have to hike the last 1 mile of road.

] Grassy Knoll Petroglyphs and Ruin San Rafael Swell Grass Knoll Petroglyphs and Ruin is an interesting adventure located near the confluence of the Price River and Grassy Creek in the San Rafael Swell. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Grassy Knoll Petroglyphs and Ruin contains some interesting rock art along with an historic structure. I would not consider this a destination site, but it is certainly worth a short visit if you find yourself with an extra hour to spare. The site is accessible year round provided the roads are not muddy. Spring and fall are the ideal times for this hike. The area is very hot in summer and cold in the winter. The time required to visit the Grassy Knoll Petroglyphs and Ruin is about an hour, including drive time from Highway 6. This is a remote desert environment, please come prepared and carry extra water. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route and in locating the rock art. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Grassy\" and \"Cedar\" show the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This route rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: In normal weather conditions a high clearance vehicles can drive to within 1/2 mile of the rock art and ruin. Real 4-wheel drive vehicles can drive right to the rock art. The San Rafael Swell is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Wellington, UT - Drive south on Highway 6 for 23 miles to mile marker 267.1 and the signed Horse Canyon turn-off. From Green River, UT - Drive west on I-70 for approximately 2 miles to the junction with highway 6. Turn north on Highway 6 and follow it for 33 miles to mile marker 267.1 and the signed Horse Canyon turn-off. From the signed Horse Canyon turn-off - (N39° 24' 38\", W110° 25' 56\") Follow the dirt road west for 1.4 miles to a fork in the road, take the left (south) fork. Drive1.3 miles to a railroad crossing (N39° 22' 43\", W110° 26' 30\"), cross the tracks and drive 0.4 miles to a fork in the road, take the right (north) fork. Drive 0.8 miles to a junction, take the left (west) road that descends the hill. Drive 1.1 miles to an old fence and a tee in the road. Turn left (south) and drive 0.3 miles to where you cross Grassy Creek. All but true 4x4 vehicles will want to stop here. After crossing the creek follow the road an additional 0.3 miles to the Grassy Knoll Petroglyphs Trailhead. Route Information: The Grassy Knoll Petroglyphs Trailhead (N39° 21' 39\", W110° 27' 55\") contains 20 or 30 boulders and large rocks covered in petroglyphs. The petroglyphs appear to be from three or four different time periods and cultures. Located on top of the ridge is the interesting Grassy Knoll Ruin (N39° 21' 41\", W110° 27' 59\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/grassyknoll.htm 1/25/2018 Grassy Knoll Petroglyphs and Ruin - Rock Art Page 2 of 2 Grassy Knoll Petroglyphs and Ruin: The site consists of many large boulders with petroglyphs on several of them. There are a couple sandal figures with transverse lines through them. One anthropomorph has a flat head, broad shoulders and a tapered trunk without extremities - Barrier Canyon Style. One Boulder is covered by a maze of interlocking lines, incorporating some small circles and enclosed spaces. Several stick figures are noted with short lower extremities but with large hands. Several small animal figures are present and one large circular figure with short legs. On top of the ridge approximately 200-yards from the rock art is an interesting circular ruin. I have been told archaeologists have studied the ruin and found evidence of occupation from Archaic to Piute (modern) times.

This is an off-trail hike that seasoned hikers will find extremely gratifying. General Information: Hurst Bridge is a enjoyable desert hike that will require 4 to 5 hours round trip. The route is 2 1/2 miles each way, with an elevation gain of 900 feet. Hurst Bridge requires you carry a least enough water for a full day of desert hiking, depending on current conditions. This is an excellent winter hike, is most popular in the spring and fall, and should be avoided during the hot summer monthes. Navigation for this route is moderate. There is no trail for over half of this route, but it should be easy for any experienced hiker. Paying attention to your map and route description is required. Mistakes in navigation are easy to overcome and correct on this route. A GPS is very useful for identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Old Woman Wash\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. This route is rated 1 I using the Canyon Rating System. You will encounter large areas of cryptobiotic crust along this route. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires five to ten years of undisturbed growth before it even becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy decades of growth. Hurst Bridge Facts: Hurst Bridge has a span of 55 feet, a height of 22 feet and 8 feet wide. The bridge was discovered in May of 1954 by Jim Hurst and friends from an airplane. Jim Hurst's son and a friend then visited the bridge from the ground. The bridge has been called Shadow Box Bridge by some. The bridge is part of a sandstone formation and is technically referred to as a meander bridge. Trailhead Information: Hurst Bridge is located in Emery County between the towns of Green River and Hanksville. From Green River, Utah follow I-70 west for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south for 19 miles to mile marker #141.7. Turn west on the good dirt road. Cross through the gate and close it behind you. Follow the dirt road west for 0.9 miles to a fork. Take the north (right) fork and follow the road for 1.9 miles to a second fork. The north (right) fork leads to an old mining derrick. Take the west (left) fork and follow it 0.3 miles to the Ernie Canyon Trailhead. The trailhead is identified by a turn around and parking area. There is a log BLM fence blocking further vehicle access to Ernie Canyon. High clearance vehicles should have no problem reaching the Ernie Canyon Trailhead. There are several primitive campsites in the area of the trailhead. Route Information: From the Ernie Canyon Trailhead (N38° 43' 44\", W110° 32' 01\") follow Ernie Canyon west as it enters the San Rafael Reef. You will hike through a deep, narrow, sandstone canyon http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/hurst.htm 1/25/2018 Hurst Bridge - San Rafael Swell - Hiking Page 2 of 2 that soon opens back up. Keep hiking along the bottom of the wash until the canyon begins to narrow up a second time. You should now be 1 mile from the trailhead. Just before the canyon begins to narrow up for a second time look 50 yards to the south (left) and you should be able to see Ernie Arch (N38° 43' 51\", W110° 33' 04\"). The arch is 40 feet long, 12 feet high and 5 feet wide. At Ernie Arch the route leaves the canyon bottom and climbs up the steep slope behind Ernie Bridge to the south rim of Ernie Canyon. From the top of the steep slope you should have some excellent views of the San Rafael Swell and Ernie Canyon. Once on top of the steep slope if you look directly west you will see a red canyon, which contains a dryfall at its head. The route circles around the red canyon to the south (left), using some benches, and enters the canyon above the dryfall. From the top of the dryfall hike northwest until you encounter a large red bowl. Hurst Bridge is in the middle tributary entering the red bowl from the north. From the red bowl hike up the middle tributary 100 yards to find Hurst Bridge (N38° 44' 10\", W110° 34' 16\"). The bridge is well hidden and is not easy to see until you are right next to it. Hurst Bridge is a 1 1/2 mile hike from Ernie Bridge. Optional Hiking Information: For those desiring more adventure you can also visit Exclamation Bridge (N38° 44' 14\", W110° 34' 32\"). This is an amazing triple bridge that might be the most impressive natural span in the San Rafael Swell. Exclamation Bridge is only 1/4 mile away from Hurst Bridge, but getting there requires excellent route finding skills and some scrambling. Anyone wishing to visit Exclamation Bridge needs to add at least two hours to their total trip time. Here is the trick to visiting Exclamation Bridge..... after you locate Hurst Bridge continue hiking up the drainage for 1/4 mile. You will be stopped by a deep chasm. Look directly west and you will see an opposing canyon entering the chasm from the west. Exclamation Bridge is a pothole style bridge located in the bottom of the west entering canyon. Hike 100 yards south to the top of the high point. As you look west you will see a large, red, cross-cut area. It looks impossible to cross but if you look near the very top of each cross-cut you will find a way to scramble across. You must cross about 3 or 4 of the cross-cuts and then hike north down one of the fingers to reach Exclamation Bridge Canyon. We were able to scramble down three different fingers to reach Exclamation Bridge without using any rope. Beginners might find a handline using a 60-foot rope to be comforting. Those who wish to visit the bottom of Exclamation Bridge will need a 50 meter rope and ascending equipment. Exclamation Bridge Facts: Exclamation Bridge was first reported by Paul J. Neiman in May 2004. The bridge has yet to be measured and is referred to as a waterfall bridge located in a sandstone rock formation.

It's a lot of work, but not much meat on the bone. If you enjoy long, pretty walks in the desert with a little spice tossed in at the halfway point this route is for you. I had heard tale of a punishing approach and a wicked keeper pothole. Instead, I found an enjoyable technical canyon with a keeper pothole that offers numerous methods of bypassing. This is one of the closest Colorado Plateau canyons to Salt Lake City, which makes it appealing to a large number of canyoneers. General Information: The North Fork of Iron Wash requires complete technical gear. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. You certainly want to avoid this route during extremely hot weather. A headlamp might be helpful near the keeper pothole as the slot can be very dark. The route contains 2 rappels, both less than 25 feet in height. A 60-foot rope is required. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 30 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. In normal conditions this canyon might require knee to waist deep wading. For those who plan to tackle the keeper pothole head on you will encounter a short swim. The keeper pothole can be bypassed with some minor climbing. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Arsons Garden\", \"Old Woman Wash\" and \"Greasewood Draw\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Iron Wash use the WGS84 datum. The North Fork of Iron Wash Canyon is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Trailhead Information: Iron Wash is located in Emery County between the towns of Green River and Hanksville. From Green River, Utah follow I-70 west for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south for 13 miles to mile marker #147. Turn west on the good dirt road. Follow the dirt road 1.6 miles to a point where you encounter a heavy thicket of tamarisk and the dirt road crosses a wash. This is the trailhead. For those interested in more adventure the dirt road continues on to Zero Gravity and the Eardley Canyon Trailheads. High clearance vehicles should have no problem reaching the Iron Wash Trailhead. Low clearance vehicles might be stopped a couple hundred yards short of the actual trailhead by a rough section in the road. Park where convenient. There are several primitive campsites in the area of the trailhead. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38° 45' 55\", W110° 28' 38\") follow Iron Wash south. After 1/2 mile http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/iron.htm 1/25/2018 Iron Wash - North Fork - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 the wash will fork ((N38° 45' 48\", W110° 29' 09\") take the west (right) fork and hike 100 yards up canyon until an escape (N38° 45' 50\", W110° 29' 16\") to the north rim of the wash presents itself. Take the escape and rim walk 250 yards west, past the top of a major dryfall (N38° 45' 48\", W110° 29' 27\"), and then re-enter the canyon drainage. From the top of the dryfall continue hiking southwest up the drainage. One mile after the dryfall you will reach a point where the wash turns west and heads back into the reef (N38° 45' 25\", W110° 30' 06\"). Instead of following the main drainage back into the reef keep going southwest (straight ahead) into a small drainage. Use the small drainage to climb to the south rim of the North Fork of Iron Wash. Once on top of the south rim the idea is to follow the rim of Iron Wash west, to a point above the technical section where it is easy to re-enter the canyon. The further south and away from the canyon rim proper that you stay the easier the approach route appears to becomes. For those who enjoy a little amusement along the way you will encounter a 1912 survey maker (N38° 45' 13\", W110° 30' 29\") 1/2 mile after exiting the small drainage if you are looking for it. There are several ways to re-enter the North Fork of Iron Wash, but one of the easiest is a small fault line canyon (N38° 44' 32\", W110° 31' 32\") located 1 mile southwest of the survey marker. The small fault line canyon drops down to the northwest and requires a very small amount of bushwhacking but no difficult downclimbing or rappels. Hike down the fault line canyon and you will be deposited in the North Fork of Iron Wash above the technical section. Rim walk west 150 yards to where a minor drainage enters from the south and a simple walk down (N38° 44' 48\", W110° 31' 54\") is located. From the bottom of the North Fork of Iron Wash it is a simple matter of hiking down canyon and enjoying the fun. The upper part of the canyon is simple and angelic. Shortly you will encounter a 15-foot rappel into a knee deep pothole. The anchor for the rappel is a bolt, or you can simply downclimb the watercourse. Continue down canyon for more fun and games. After a short distance the canyon will really tighten up. This is not a problem for large frame canyoneers but everyone will know when they reach the squeeze portion of the route. The squeeze is about 50-feet long and ends at the signature \"keeper pothole\". This is a pothole with steep sides that is 15-feet deep and 15-feet across. The water is almost never deep enough that you can just swim across the top of the pothole so be prepared to deal with this obstacle. The hardcore will probably want to attack the keeper pothole head on and escape using one of several techniques in their bag of tricks. This could include using a pack toss, cheater stick, hooks or any other shrewd method that a wise canyoneer can think of. Escaping this pothole is good practice for more advanced canyons. If dealing with a keeper pothole is not your idea of a fun day then you will want to use the by-pass, or at least get one member of your party across the keeper pothole to where they can assist everyone else across. Once you have one member of your party across the keeper pothole it should be simple to bring the remaining members across. The by-pass allows anyone using it to remain dry. The pothole by-pass is one of the most ingenious bypasses routes I have encountered. The party that first figured this out did an outstanding job. From the edge of the keeper pothole you can look up and see a huge log wedged between the canyon walls 25-feet above your head. The trick to the by-pass is to get on top of this log. To do that you must climb 50-feet, back up Iron Wash, to where the squeeze first begins. From the top of the squeeze you use a small ledge system that allows you to chimney up to the log. The climbing is easy, probably 5.1 or 5.2, but the penalty points are high if you fall. Once on top of the log it is a simple matter of using the log as an anchor and rappelling 25-feet back to the bottom of the canyon. There is no good method that I could see to belay the chimney. Bottom line is don't fall. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/iron.htm 1/25/2018 Iron Wash - North Fork - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 From the downstream side of the keeper pothole it is just a simple and easy 4 mile stroll back to the trailhead. Follow the drainage downstream and it's almost impossible to get lost. Optional Hiking Information: It is possible to hike up the bottom of North Fork of Iron Wash until stopped by the keeper pothole. This route is approximately 4 miles each was and should require 4 hours round trip. This is a pretty canyon that would make an enjoyable winter hike.

This canyon varies from difficult to easy depending on water conditions. The route ends with an enjoyable stroll up the impressive Muddy Creek Gorge. There are several old uranium mines in the area, the largest and most well known being the Hidden Splendor (Delta) Mine. General Information: Knotted Rope Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon consists of several short swims, wading, several possible rappels and plenty of fun scrambling. Total time required for a round trip is 6 to 7 hours if a shuttle car is used. Add one hour if no shuttle car is available. I recommend a minimum group size of three because of the sometimes challenging potholes. Three people greatly expands your options of defeating the potholes with a margin of safety. Knotted Rope Canyon requires complete technical gear. There are several swims and a wetsuit is essential during colder weather. A 60 foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, please do not bolt this canyon. The canyon is easy to descend using natural anchors. When the potholes are full of water, this canyon offers few difficulties. When the potholes are low on water, this canyon increases in difficulty. In years past, pipes from the mining ruins had been carried down to defeat the first two keeper potholes. Some of these pipes have recently washed out and the canyon is slightly more challenging. All of the potholes can be defeated with average climbing skills or a pack toss. If you have trouble exiting a pothole, you might be able to exit using partner assist techniques. You can also tie a rope to a backpack (this might require several backpacks) and toss the pack over the lip of the pothole (hold on to the end of the rope). The backpack acts as a counterweight and will give you the option of using the rope as a handline and allow you to escape the pothole. This method works best if you toss the pack before entering the pothole. Go prepare for various water levels and use your imagination and creativity to bypass the potholes. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Hunt Draw\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. There are many good camping spots near the trailhead. Knotted Rope is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the weather report and the sky above your head before entering this canyon. The entire drainage is easily visible before committing to this route. Hidden Splendor Mine: Vernon Pick, a middle-aged electrician from Minnesota, discovered the Delta Mine (Hidden Splendor) northwest of Hanksville in 1952. Vernon Pick reaped one million dollars from the mine before he sold it two years later to international financier Floyd Odlum's Atlas Corporation for $9 million and a custom-converted PBY airplane. In November 1954 Life http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/knotted.htm 1/25/2018 Knotted Rope Canyon - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Magazine published and 11-page article titled \"Vernon Pick's $10 million Ordeal\" that detailed the discovery of the Delta Mine. Publicity from this article greatly increased prospecting in the San Rafael Swell and surrounding Colorado Plateau and made the Delta Mine famous. Floyd Odlum renamed his new purchase the Hidden Splendor Mine. Odlum was certain the mine was a rich find and his geologists estimated the mine held 540,000 tons of uranium ore with an in-place value of forty dollars per ton. This would have made the mine worth nearly 22 million dollars. However, the Atlas Corporation only extracted 90,000 tons of ore from the mine before abandoning it in 1957. Local wags then dubbed the mine \"Odlum's Hidden Blunder\". After Atlas Corporation left several others tried unsuccessfully to extract ore. The Uranus Corporation took over the mine for a short time in cooperation with Central Oil. The Hidden Splendor Mine closed in 1957 and was eventually sold for taxes. Trailhead Information: Any car during good weather can access this trailhead. The San Rafael Swell is criss- crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Green River, Utah follow I-70 west for 29 miles to the underpass at mile marker #131. From the cattle guard on the south side of the underpass, follow the graded dirt road signed U24/Goblin Valley/Temple Mountain, for 10.2 miles to the signed Red Canyon/Tan Seep junction. Take the right (west) fork for 3.8 miles to the signed Red Canyon/Mckay Flat junction. Turn right (west) and follow the road for 0.9 miles to the signed Mckay Flat junction. Take the left (South) fork for 8.6 miles to the signed Hidden Splendor Mine junction. At the Hidden Splendor Mine junction take the left (South) fork and follow it for 10.2 miles to the Hidden Splendor Airstrip (N38° 34' 08\", W110° 57' 22\"). The airstrip is identified by an information kiosk and a wind sock. Do not park or camp on the airstrip. The Hidden Splendor Airstrip is an official aircraft landing strip operated by the BLM and the Utah Backcountry Pilots association. Aircraft may be encountered at any time. Any interference with aircraft or aircraft operations is a federal crime. The Hidden Splendor Airstrip is where the route ends and is where you leave a shuttle vehicle or mountain bike. From the Hidden Splendor Airstrip, retrace the route you followed for 2.2 miles to a rough track on the right (south) side of the road (N38° 35' 06\", W110° 55' 32\"). Passenger vehicles might have a difficult time driving the finial distance to the actual trailhead and can be parked where convenient. Turn south on the rough track and follow it for 0.6 miles to a fork in the road and an old car. This is the trailhead (N38° 34' 43\", W110° 55' 13\"). This is also the trailhead for Quandary Canyon. There are several nice campsites in the vicinity of the Trailhead. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38° 34' 43\", W110° 55' 13\") located at the old abandoned 1950 Ford, take the right (west) fork and follow the miners track as it winds it's way up through the notch in the Wingate Sandstone. Just after you pass through the notch and enter a small, interesting bowl (N38° 34' 23\", W110° 55' 37\") look west as the miners track veers south and enters Quandary Canyon, do not follow the miners track down Quandary Canyon. Looking west from the small bowl, you should see a steep gully with a large chokestone at the top. Follow the hiker made trail up the steep gully, around the chokestone and under a second chokestone that is referred to as Wayne's Wiggle (N38° 34' 22\", W110° 55' 44\"). Wayne's http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/knotted.htm 1/25/2018 Knotted Rope Canyon - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 Wiggle is steep fourth class with no exposure. At one time a knotted rope hung through the wiggle and is where the route received it's name. From the top of Wayne's Wiggle head west to the top of the escarpment and enjoy the spectacular view. From the top of Wayne's Wiggle you must follow the top of the escarpment southwest for almost one mile to reach the head of Knotted Rope Canyon (N38° 34' 04\", W110° 56' 23\"). At the head of the canyon are the remains of cabins, drill holes and pipes left behind by the Atlas Corporation when they abandoned the site in 1957. From the mining ruins just head down the canyon and let the excitement begin. The canyon narrows up shortly and contains several keeper potholes. The first big keeper and the crux of the route can be easily defeated with moderate climbing skills by scrambling around the west (right) side using the small ledges and handholds. The remainder of the canyon is a pothole thrash or water fun park depending on water conditions and your skill level. After the technical section the canyon opens up and becomes much easier. Follow the slickrock canyon down until it makes a sharp right (west) turn (N38° 32' 38\", W110° 55' 57\"). There is and easy to spot hiker trail leading out of the canyon bottom straight ahead (south). Follow the hiker made trail up and over the canyon rim and down to Muddy Creek (N38° 32' 13\", W110° 56' 03\"). Follow Muddy Creek upstream through the extraordinary Muddy Creek Gorge to the Miners Cabin (N38° 33' 24\", W110° 57' 03\"). From the Miners Cabin, it is easy to follow the old mining track up to the Hidden Splendor Airstrip (N38° 34' 08\", W110° 57' 22\"). Optional Route #1: For the hardcore, it is possible to follow Knotted Rope Canyon all the way to Muddy Creek. This route includes a 280-foot rappel, which is partially free air. When the canyon makes the sharp right turn just keep following the drainage and do not hike out over the canyon rim. The 280-foot rappel is reached after a short hike and deposits you in the bottom of Muddy Creek Gorge. Optional Route #2: It is possible for a team of competent and experienced canyoneers to reverse Knotted Rope and climb up the canyon. This method is occasionally used to combine Quandary Canyon and Knotted Rope into a fun, but difficult, all day loop hike. A group of at least three is suggest for this option because teamwork is mandatory. Having a skilled rock climber in the group is a bonus. This option is not for beginners.

Many canyoneers have driven past its humdrum trailhead and walked past its concealed exit without the slightest clue of what they just missed. Music Canyon received its name on the first known descent. The story goes that a woman accompanying the group had a beautiful voice and when they reached a dark cavern referred to as \"The Music Chamber\" she began to sing and the acoustics were remarkable. General Information: Music Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon consists of knee to waist deep wading, downclimbing, rappels up to 20 feet and plenty of fun. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 8 to 9 hours. A car or bicycle shuttle is required to complete this route in the preferred method. The exit for this route uses The Chute of Muddy Creek. During high spring runoff this route could be difficult. High water through this canyon usually lasts a very short time but caution and sound judgment should be used as always. Under normal conditions you might encounter waist deep water in The Chute of Muddy Creek. Music Canyon requires complete technical gear. A 50 meter rope, several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. I suggest a maximum group size of six because of the slow going involved with larger groups. This canyon has been downclimbed by competent canyoneers and those with good teamwork skills. All others will require up to three rappels of approximately 20 feet in height. I suggest a 50 meter rope because this canyon is done using only natural anchors and the nearest natural anchor is often located 50 to 60 feet up canyon. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. This canyon has been used in the past by the University of Utah Canyoneering Program as a classroom canyon. This means that hundreds of giggling coeds have descended this canyon before you without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors that is moderately difficult in this canyon. In place of bolts, teamwork and partner assisted techniques are used extensively in this canyon so go prepared. A GPS is useful in identifying the correct trailhead and checking that you are on course. Navigation for this route is easy. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Tomsich Butte\" and \"Hunt Draw\" are essential. Music Canyon is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a high flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/music.htm 1/25/2018 Music Canyon - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Trailhead Information: Any car during good weather can access this trailhead. The San Rafael Swell is criss- crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Green River, Utah follow I-70 west for 29 miles to the underpass at mile marker #131. From the cattle guard on the south side of the underpass, follow the graded dirt road signed U24/Goblin Valley/Temple Mountain, for 10.2 miles to the signed Red Canyon/Tan Seep junction. Take the right (west) fork for 3.8 miles to the signed Red Canyon/Mckay Flat junction. Turn right (west) and follow the road for 0.9 miles to the signed Mckay Flat junction. Take the left (South) fork for 8.6 miles to the signed Hidden Splendor Mine junction. At the Hidden Splendor Mine junction take the left (South) fork and follow it for 4.0 miles to a point just beyond where the road crosses the Music Canyon drainage. This is the trailhead, park where you can. If you intend to use a shuttle vehicle you must continue down the road for 6.2 miles to the Hidden Splendor Airstrip. The airstrip is identified by an information kiosk. Near the airstrip is a great place to camp with spectacular views of the Muddy River Gorge. The airstrip is where you must leave your shuttle vehicle. Do not park or camp on the airstrip. The Hidden Splendor Airstrip is an official aircraft landing strip operated by the BLM and the Utah Backcountry Pilots association. Aircraft may be encountered at any time. Any interference with aircraft or aircraft operations is a federal crime. Route Information: From the Music Canyon Trailhead (N38° 37' 24\", W110° 54' 43\"), hike down into the canyon bottom and follow it downstream. If you located the correct trailhead it is almost impossible to get lost from here to the finish. The first part of the route is just an interesting stroll down a typical open San Rafael canyon bottom. You should have a large sandstone cliff to your right and steep mud hills to your left with a few minor obstacles in the canyon bottom to stop you from being bored. After 2 1/4 miles the canyon makes a sharp dogleg (N38° 38' 30\", W110° 56' 32\") to the left (LDC). Just keep hiking down the canyon and it will begin to slot up (N38° 38' 03\", W110° 57' 17\") after 1 mile. The next 1 1/2 miles to Muddy Creek is the meat of the sandwich. The narrows start shallow and keep getting narrower, deeper and more exhilarating until you reach The Chute of Muddy Creek. This route has lots of obstacles that are not difficult to overcome if you look around and consider using good teamwork. Belaying leading canyoneers and spotting following canyoneers is a popular tool in this canyon. Not to far from Muddy Creek you will downclimb into a deep, dark cavern known as the Music Chamber. For a little fun try singing a favorite song. After leaving the Music Chamber you will downclimb several short obstacles and start to hear the cascading Muddy River. Shortly you will pop out in the upper section of The Chute of Muddy Creek. It is interesting to notice how well the exit into The Chute is hidden. The technical portion of the route is finished but you still have a great hike ahead of you. From the exit of Music Canyon (N38° 37' 46\", W110° 58' 27\") begin hiking downstream through the narrowest section of The Chute. After 4 1/4 miles the narrows will open and you will reach the mouth of Chimney Canyon (N38° 35' 47\", W110° 58' 13\") on your right (LDC). From Chimney Canyon it is 1 1/2 miles downstream to the mouth of Mud Canyon (N38° 34' 51\", W110° 57' 54\") on your left (LDC). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/music.htm 1/25/2018 Music Canyon - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 From Mud Canyon it is 1 1/2 miles downstream to where an easily visible track (N38° 33' 59\", W110° 57' 41\") begins winding its way up the east cliff. Follow the track up the cliff for 1/2 mile to the Hidden Splendor Airstrip (N38° 34' 07\", W110° 57' 25\"). Optional Route Information: Music Canyon can be completed as a canyon down to Muddy Creek and than climbing back up. This will eliminate the need for a shuttle vehicle. The route is shorter this way but the return hike is not as exciting. The actual Music Canyon route takes 3 hours each way. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Tomsich Butte\" is the required map. Music Canyon is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. The climb up the canyon is rated 5.7 using the YDS climbing rating system. The climb up canyon consists of several bouldering problems with fall potentials of 20 feet or less. I suggest you bring a good climber along or a few sections of rope to fix the canyon at several potentially difficult spots. It is common to leave a rope or webbing at any drop you feel might offer a difficult challenge to climb back up. Two sections of 50-foot rope and one section of 70-foot rope should be sufficient to fix the canyon. You can also have your climber first test the pitch to see if there will be any problems before fixing a rope. Please clean all fixed ropes from the canyon upon your exit.

This is one of the most scenic canyons in the area. Several rewarding route options are presented to meet the desires of the novice, intermediate or expert canyoneer. General Information: Quandary Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure and requires complete technical gear. A 100 foot rope, several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. Those doing Quandary Direct should bring a second 100 foot rope to help work the keeper pothole section. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Hunt Draw\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. This canyon has a modest flash flood danger, but don't let that fool you. At least one person has died in this canyon as a result of a flash flood. Check the weather report and the sky above your head before entering this canyon. The entire drainage is easily visible before committing to this route. Quandary By-Pass: Quandary By-Pass is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. The technical portion of the canyon consists of knee to chest deep wading and fun scrambling. The By-Pass Route is suggested for those doing their first descent of the canyon or those with less than advanced canyoneering skills. A wetsuit is not usually required. The longest rappel in the canyon is 50 feet. Total time required for a round trip using the By-Pass Route is 6 to 8 hours. Quandary Direct: Quandary Direct is rated 4B III using the Canyon Rating System. The technical portion of the canyon consists of several short swims, wading and fun scrambling. The Direct Route contains several keeper potholes that you must escape. This is not a route for novice, those lacking the proper skills might become skeleton soup. Advanced canyoneering techniques are required to escape the keeper potholes and locate or construct natural rappel anchors. A wetsuit is advised for those doing the Direct Route since you might be in the water for some time. The longest rappel in the canyon is 50 feet. Total time required for a round trip using the Direct Route is 8 to 10 hours. You will most like encounter three major problems in the Direct Route. These problems consist of very deep potholes that will contain varying levels of water. Do not enter a pothole and pull your rope until you have one member of your group safely out of the pothole. If you have trouble exiting a pothole, you might be able to exit using partner assist techniques. You can also tie a rope to a backpack (this might require several backpacks) and toss the pack over the lip of the pothole (hold on to the end of the rope). The backpack acts as a counterweight and will give you the option of using the rope as a handline and allow you to escape the pothole. Go prepare for various water levels and use your imagination and creativity to bypass the potholes. Trailhead Information: Any car during good weather can access this trailhead. The San Rafael Swell is criss- crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/quandary.htm 1/25/2018 Quandary Canyon - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 From Green River, Utah follow I-70 west for 29 miles to the underpass at mile marker #131. From the cattle guard on the south side of the underpass, follow the graded dirt road signed U24/Goblin Valley/Temple Mountain, for 10.2 miles to the signed Red Canyon/Tan Seep junction. Take the right (west) fork for 3.8 miles to the signed Red Canyon/Mckay Flat junction. Turn right (west) and follow the road for 0.9 miles to the signed Mckay Flat junction. Take the left (South) fork for 8.6 miles to the signed Hidden Splendor Mine junction. At the Hidden Splendor Mine junction take the left (South) fork and follow it for 8.0 miles to a rough track on the south side of the road (N38° 35' 06\", W110 55' 32\"). Passenger vehicles might have a difficult time driving the finial distance to the actual trailhead and can be parked where convenient. Turn south on the rough track and follow it for 0.6 miles to a fork in the road and an old car. This is the trailhead (N38° 34' 43\", W110° 55' 13\"). This is also the trailhead for Knotted Rope Canyon. There are several nice campsites in the vicinity of the Trailhead. If you plan to use the Optional Muddy Creek Gorge Route presented below you might want to leave a shuttle vehicle near the Hidden Splendor Airstrip (N38° 34' 08\", W110° 57' 22\"). To reach the airstrip retrace your route 0.6 miles back to the well maintained dirt road and follow it east for an additional 2.2 miles. The airstrip is identified by an information kiosk and wind sock. Camping near the airstrip with its spectacular views of Muddy Creek Gorge is popular. Do not park or camp on the airstrip. The Hidden Splendor Airstrip is an official aircraft landing strip operated by the BLM and the Utah Backcountry Pilots association. Aircraft may be encountered at any time. Any interference with aircraft or aircraft operations is a federal crime. Route Information: From the trailhead (N38° 34' 43\", W110° 55' 13\") located at the old abandoned 1950 Ford, take the west (right) fork and follow the miners track as it winds it's way up through the notch in the Wingate Sandstone. Just after you pass through the notch you will enter a small, interesting bowl (N38° 34' 23\", W110° 55' 37\"), follow the drainage as it exits the small bowl and begins to enter a narrow canyon. Let the fun begin! The first rappel appears very quickly and is 12-foot high anchored from a sandstone bollard. The skilled canyoneer will be able to downclimb this drop. Shortly after the first rappel a second 12-foot rappel is encountered. This rappel is anchored by a a large rock. The canyon then opens into an exquisite glen. Keep following the watercourse through the glen and you will pass under a charming natural bridge. At the bottom of the glen the canyon begins to narrow up again. Next you will encounter a difficult looking 30-foot chute that leads into a pothole. The chute is easier to downclimb than it looks but some people climb up out of the canyon on the west side and rappel 50 feet from a small arch back into the canyon bottom just below the obstacle. The ensuing canyon really narrows up with some minor pothole fun tossed in for added excitement. You might encounter some water in this section of canyon. After squeezing through a narrow and tilted section of canyon its time to pay attention to your route. The canyon opens into a short easy section and than turns sharply to the right (N38° 33' 24\", W110° 55' 34\"), followed immediately by a small pothole that leads to a big drop. Retreat 75 feet to the sharp right and the open section of canyon and listen up! Direct Route: The Direct Route is to the right and follows the watercourse. Rappel the big drop noted earlier and continue down the canyon. You will encounter several deep and difficult to escape http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/quandary.htm 1/25/2018 Quandary Canyon - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 keeper potholes. This section is rather short and rejoins those using the By-Pass Route in 1/4 mile (N38° 33' 14\", W110° 55' 23\"). By-Pass Route: The By-Pass Route is to the left and climbs the obvious short gully heading southeast. From the top of the gully, do NOT drop immediately back into the canyon at the next opportunity. Instead climb up and through the small saddle and traverse along the top of a steep sandstone slab. The further east you stay against the cliffs the easier the route is. You will soon interest a large canyon wall and descend a steep gully. When climbing down the gully you will climb over, under and through some large boulders. The By-Pass Route is only about 1/4 mile around and soon rejoins the main canyon (N38° 33' 14\", W110° 55' 23\"). All Together Again: A few more minor obstacles present themselves and than you will encounter a big drop. Climb the small ridge to the east and hike down the sandstone slab. Two large pools are bypassed to the east. Immediately after the second pool Quandary Canyon dumps you out onto the front of the reef and into a major dry wash (N38° 32' 52\", W110° 55' 12\"). Turn east and begin slogging up the dry wash. After 1 1/2 miles you will come to a giant S-turn in the wash that is interrupted by a 30-foot dry fall. Climb around the dryfall and continue hiking for an additional 1/2 mile. Keep a good lookout to the north and you can easily identify Ramp Canyon slicing through the reef shortly before you encounter the Ramp Canyon/Dry Wash Junction (N38° 33' 44\", W110° 53' 48\"). For some reason this junction is often missed by hikers looking for the entrance to Ramp Canyon, so pay attention! You can easily identify Ramp Canyon cutting through the reef about 200 yards before reaching the actual junction. Turn north and begin hiking up Ramp Canyon. Follow the snaking watercourse as it slices through the reef. This canyon is quite short but remarkably beautiful. Ramp Canyon has some of the prettiest swirling sandstone narrows you will encounter on the route. A twin tiered dryfall is bypassed by using the steep slope to the left. You will encounter more obstacles but they are quite fun and not that difficult to negotiate. Near the top of Ramp Canyon you will encounter the crux of the canyon. The crux consists of a huge chokestone blocking the watercourse. This is bypassed by using a thin ramp or dike on the left side of the canyon. While the ramp is not extremely difficult to climb it does require a 5.6 climbing move that is difficult to protect. A slip will likely result in a 20-foot fall complete with injuries. Use caution, you should have at least one experienced rock climber or canyoneer in your group when attempting to climb up the ramp. All novice should be belayed. From the top of the ramp keep hiking up the watercourse and you will soon be spit out on the backside of the reef. The canyon bottom quickly turns into a wash that briskly turns into a rough track. Follow the rough track 3/4 miles northwest to the trailhead and call it a day. Optional Route #1: For those worried about the difficulty in finding and ascending Ramp Canyon it is possible to return using the easier but longer Muddy Creek Gorge. From the mouth of Quandary Canyon follow the dry wash west for 1 1/2 miles until it interests Muddy Creek (N38° 32' 13\", W110° 56' 03\"). After locating Muddy Creek follow it upstream through the impressive Muddy Creek Gorge to the Miners Cabin (N38° 33' 24\", W110° 57' 03\"). From the Miners Cabin, follow the old mining track up to the Hidden Splendor Airstrip (N38° 34' 08\", W110° 57' 22\"). If using this optional route you might consider leaving a shuttle vehicle or mountain bike at the Hidden Splendor Airstrip to eliminate 2 1/2 miles of road walking back to the trailhead. Those using this optional route will need to add at least one hour to their total required trip time. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/quandary.htm 1/25/2018 Quandary Canyon - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 4 of 4 Optional Route #2: It is possible for a team of competent and experienced canyoneers to reverse Quandary Canyon and use the By-Pass Route to climb up the canyon. This method is occasionally used to combine Knotted Rope and Quandary Canyon into a fun, but difficult, all day loop hike. The trick to using this route is once you reach the natural bridge near at the top of Quandary Canyon you must route find northwest and intersect the Knotted Rope route. This option is not for beginners. Video: Enjoy a short video of Quandary Canyon in the San Rafael Swell compliments of Blake Merrell.

The most famous of the panels includes a pictograph known as Wavey Arms, also known as Wavy Hands. General Information: Short Canyon is a great hike for the entire family. The route provides access to several interesting panels of rock art. The route is accessible year round provided the roads are not muddy. Spring and fall are the preferred seasons to visit. An easy 2 mile round trip hike takes you to all the rock art sites and requires a couple of hours. A GPS is extremely useful in verifying you are on the correct route and in locating the rock art. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Short Canyon\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. This route is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Short Canyon is accessible to all high clearance vehicles in dry weather conditions. From Ferron, Utah: From Center and Main Street in Ferron, Utah. Turn south on State Street (UT-10) and follow it for 5.1 miles. Turn left (east) onto County Road 801 and follow it for 2.0 miles. Continue (left) onto County Road 802 and follow it for 1.7 miles. Turn left (east) onto County Road 803 and follow it for 4.8 miles (mile marker 8.0) to a dirt road on the left (north). From Emery, Utah: From Center and Main Street in Emery, Utah. Turn east on Main Street (UT-10) and follow it for 3.5 miles. Turn right (east) onto County Road 801 and follow it for 2.7 miles. Turn right (east) onto County Road 803 and follow it for 5.4 miles (mile marker 8.0) to a dirt road on the left (north). From the Dirt Road: From the dirt road that leads north from mile marker 8.0 (N38° 56' 32\", W111° 05' 05\"), follow the dirt road north for 2.3 miles to a smaller dirt road (N38° 58' 22\", W111° 03' 52\") on the left (west). Follow the smaller dirt road west for 3.9 miles as it winds its way into Short Canyon. To the Short Canyon Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify as the road becomes very rough at this point and it's easy to turn around. It is possible to continue driving the dirt road, but it will require a real 4x4. Route Information: From the Short Canyon Trailhead (N38° 58' 39\", W111° 04' 57\"), just follow the ATV trail west into Short Canyon. After hiking about 300-yards you will see several concretions (N38° 58' http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/shortcanyon.htm 1/25/2018 Short Canyon - San Rafael Swell Page 2 of 2 34\", W111° 05' 07\"), which are large (10-foot round) gray rock balls. The concretions are located in a band along the north wall of the canyon. Continue hiking west and 1/2 mile from the trailhead you will encounter John McDonald Hole (canyon) joining from the right (north). Just before the junction if you look north you will see the Red Sheep Pictograph (N38° 58' 26\", W111° 05' 20\") located under an overhang at the base of the cliff. The pictograph is easy to see from the trail. If you wish to visit the panel just follow the emerging social trail that climbs to the base of the cliff. From the junction with John McDonald Hole take the left (west) fork and continue hiking for 1/2 mile to the end of the ATV trail. From the end of the ATV trail continue hiking up canyon for 100-yards to where a small boulder choked side drainage enters from the right (north). Follow the social trail to the right (east) of the side drainage as it climbs to the base of the cliff and the easy to identify Wavey Arms Pictograph (N38° 58' 14\", W111° 05' 36\"). You can hike east along the base of the cliff for 100-yards and encounter several minor panels of rock art, including what some call the Two headed Snake (N38° 58' 15\", W111° 05' 33\"). From where you encountered the small boulder choked side drainage you can bushwhack up the main drainage a short distance to Short Canyon Spring and a large rock art panel (N38° 58' 12\", W111° 05' 39\") that contains both pictographs and petroglyphs. Searching along the base of the cliff will also reveal several other lesser panels of rock art. Return the way you came. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

It is also one of the most difficult and not a route for beginners. The canyon slices through the Moroni Slopes and ends with a marvelous plunge into the beautiful Muddy River Gorge. The Squeeze is the drainage for the large bowl located on top of the Moroni Slopes known as Segers Hole. The Squeeze is extremely dazzling with sculpted sandstone and never ending water filled potholes. Many of the potholes are referred to as \"keeper potholes\" because they are extremely difficult to exit. General Information: The Squeeze is a technical canyoneering adventure. The technical portion of the canyon consists of wading, swimming, downclimbing, rappels up to 100 feet, pothole thrashing and plenty of fun. This route is suggested for experienced canyoneers only. The route contains numerous keeper potholes, which require a variety of techniques to escape. We found all potholes escapable with coordinated teamwork; changing water conditions or inexperienced team members could alter this fact. The water in the San Rafael Swell is usually bathtub warm if the weather has been hot. However, I suggest shorty wet suits as a minimum because you will be in the water and shade for several hours. If the weather has been cold, more protection will be required in the form of full wet suits or dry suit. Total time required for a round trip is 7 to 8 hours. The approach and exit routes can add an additional 2 to 4 hours to the route depending on which trailhead you use. I recommend a minimum group size of three because of the large amount of partner assisted obstacles you will encounter. I suggest a maximum group size of six because of the slow going involved with larger groups. Team work and partner assisted techniques are used extensively in this canyon so go prepared. The Squeeze requires complete technical gear. The longest rappel is 100-feet and requires a 60 meter rope (two 100-foot ropes work exceptionally well in this canyon). Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links and a prusik system are required. A pair of bat hooks, etriers, and a 12-foot cheater stick with a skyhook attached to the end are suggested. A short 60-foot rope is also helpful for the numerous short drops, belays and hand lines required. Only four rappels in this canyon require a rope longer than 60 feet. I also suggest a spare rappel device because of the large number of floating disconnects required if this canyon is filled with water. The canyon contains numerous bolted anchors; some of the anchors are of questionable quality so use caution. If you must replace a bolt, do a skillful job. Please do not add additional bolts to this canyon, it contains all the bolts required. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/squeeze.htm 1/25/2018 The Squeeze - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Hunt Draw\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate to difficult. The route involves several miles of cross-country navigation and route finding through rock bands. The Squeeze is rated 4B IV using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a high flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Trailhead Information: The Squeeze has two popular trailheads; both have their good and bad points. The most straightforward and easiest access is from Factory Butte. The most beautiful and fun is from Hidden Splendor. I will describe the good and bad of both trailheads and you can make your own decision on which is best. Hidden Splendor Trailhead: Any car during good weather can access this trailhead. The San Rafael Swell is criss- crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Green River, Utah follow I-70 west for 29 miles to the underpass at mile marker 131. From the cattle guard on the south side of the underpass, follow the graded dirt road signed U24/Goblin Valley/Temple Mountain, for 10.2 miles to the signed Red Canyon/Tan Seep junction. Take the right (west) fork for 3.8 miles to the signed Red Canyon/Mckay Flat junction. Turn right (west) and follow the road for 0.9 miles to the signed Mckay Flat junction. Take the left (South) fork for 8.6 miles to the signed Hidden Splendor Mine junction. At the Hidden Splendor Mine junction take the left (South) fork and follow it for 10.2 miles to the Hidden Splendor Airstrip (N38° 34' 08\", W110° 57' 22\"). Camping near the airstrip is very popular and remarkably picturesque. The Hidden Splendor Mine contains numerous relics to explore. Do not park or camp on the airstrip. The Hidden Splendor Airstrip is an official aircraft landing strip operated by the BLM and the Utah Backcountry Pilots association. Aircraft may be encountered at any time. Any interference with aircraft or aircraft operations is a federal crime. The Hidden Splendor Airstrip is where the adventure begins. Anyone accessing this route with a car must start hiking here. It will take you approximately 1 1/2 hours to reach the actual trailhead. Anyone with a real 4-wheel drive can continue driving down the road for 1 1/4 miles to the Miner's Cabin (N38° 33' 24\", W110° 57' 03\") located in the bottom of the Muddy River Gorge. Some smart-asses refer to the Miner's Cabin as Motel 6. Everyone using the Hidden Splendor Trailhead must now begin hiking down canyon from the Miner's Cabin. It will take you approximately 1 hour to reach the actual trailhead from the Miner's Cabin. From the Miner's Cabin hike down canyon following the closed to vehicle's mining track. The Muddy River Gorge is a beautiful hike, which criss-crosses the Muddy River for an additional 2 1/2 miles to the actual trailhead. The trailhead is located at a grove of cottonwood trees where the Muddy River exits the Muddy River Gorge (N38° 32' 11\", W110° 56' 00\"). Factory Butte Trailhead: Factory Butte is the most direct access to the route, camping in the area is very ugly and uninviting. Any high clearance vehicle during good weather can access this trailhead. There are several reasonable campsites along the access road near Factory Butte. These campsites are exposed to the wind with no shade, but are free from bugs and mosquitoes. The are several campsites next to the Muddy River, but the bugs and mosquitoes can be atrocious during certain times of the year, particularly late spring. From Hanksville, Utah follow Highway 24 west for 10.5 miles to mile marker 105.7 (N38° 22' 01\", W110° 53' 32\"). The Factory Butte road is located on the north side of Highway 24 and http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/squeeze.htm 1/25/2018 The Squeeze - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 is signed \"6650 East\". The road is graded and well maintained for the first 10 miles. From Highway 24 turn north and follow the Factory Butte road for 9.5 miles to a fork in the main road. Take the left fork and travel 1.0 mile to a tee in the road. Turn right and continue for 3.2 miles to where the road crosses the Muddy River (N38° 31' 49\", W110° 54' 12\"). The Muddy River Crossing is where the adventure begins. Everyone accessing this route must start hiking here. From this point, it is 2 1/4 miles of flat and easy hiking to reach the actual trailhead. It will take you approximately 1 hour of hiking to reach the actual trailhead. From the Muddy River Crossing begin hiking upstream following the closed to vehicle's mining track that criss-crosses the river to the actual trailhead. Just before the trailhead the seasonal flowing Salt Wash joins from the west. The trailhead is located at a grove of cottonwood trees where the Muddy River exits the Muddy River Gorge (N38° 32' 11\", W110° 56' 00\"). Route Information: From the trailhead, located at the grove of cottonwood trees near the mouth of the Muddy River Gorge, you must climb up the Moroni Slopes to the west. From the point of the nose in the cliff band that pokes into the grove of cottonwood trees there is a small hiker made trail, which threads it's way through the lower cliff band and begins climbing up the slope. Follow the ridge up for approximately 20 minutes (N38° 32' 02\", W110° 56' 55\") until you can easily cross the canyon to your right (north) and climb the next ridge over (N38° 32' 16\", W110° 57' 11\"). Continue hiking up to the ridge and you will shortly find yourself standing at the top of a small cliff band, with an impressive view looking down into the Squeeze. If you look to the northwest, you should be able to easily recognize the volcanic vent in Segers Hole. From the top of the cliff band to the bottom of the Squeeze, you are on your own. Well not completely, I will give you the general layout and give you a few suggestions. It seems that nobody has yet discovered a great way to get from the canyon rim to the canyon bottom. The general idea is the more west you head the more of the Middle Squeeze you get to do. The Middle Squeeze is fun hiking through a narrow canyon and since you put all this effort into hiking clear up here, you might as well get the biggest bang for your buck. If you mess up in this section no big deal, just find the easiest route possible to the canyon floor. You might have to set up a rappel to complete this task. My suggestion is to work your way through the cliff band at the canyon rim and aim for the small bowl in the top of the minor tributary. From here you can climb a short distance to a small saddle (N38° 32' 33\", W110° 57' 37\") between the tributary and the Squeeze. If you find the saddle you can work your way down the sandstone fins to the floor of the Squeeze (N38° 32' 37\", W110° 57' 40\"). This part of the route involves some sketchy downclimbing or a simple rappel. Yeehaw, you have made it into the Squeeze, let the fun begin. Start strolling down canyon and enjoy the swirling sandstone and narrow slot. After a short warm up the excitement really begins. This canyon has dozens of potholes. Some are deep and some are shallow, and some are just right. The canyon is at it's easiest when it is almost dry or completely filled with water. When the canyon is only partially filled with water some of the potholes could be difficult to exit, so go prepared. Often there is a rope set up to provide a tyrolean traverse over two of the more difficult potholes. This canyon requires teamwork to complete. Most obstacles can be defeated using several different methods, use your creativity and experiment. Partner assist, pack toss and cheater sticks are some of the methods we have used in the past. We completed seventeen rappels in the canyon; stronger climbers will need less while weaker climbers will discover more are required. There are two rappels that are 100 feet in http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/squeeze.htm 1/25/2018 The Squeeze - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 4 of 4 height. About 100 yards downstream of the first 100-foot rappel you will find a series of three deep keeper potholes in a wide section of canyon. It is easy to bypass these potholes using the ledge system on the right (LDC) or you can just blast through the potholes for more fun. The canyon contains two charming natural bridges in the canyon bottom, which you must walk under. The final rappel is free air to the edge of a pond and spring (N38° 32' 19\", W110° 56' 14\"). Hope you have as much fun in this canyon as I did. Video: Enjoy a short video from The Squeeze. This video is provided courtesy of Summitseeker. Direct link to the video on YouTube. Miner's Approach: In recent years the Miners Approach has become the preferred way of canyoneering The Squeeze. The route begins at the Miner's Cabin (N38° 33' 24\", W110° 57' 03\") located in the bottom of the Muddy River Gorge, which is accessed from the Hidden Splendor Trailhead. From the Miner's Cabin hike downstream for 3/4 mile to the first major bend in the Muddy River Gorge (N38° 32' 52\", W110° 57' 08\"). The river gorge direction goes from a mostly north to south direction, to a northwest to southeast direction. Look to the south wall of the gorge for an earth ramp to overcome the cliff bands. Take a minute to scan the route you will take, it will resemble a backwards \"Z\" route to hug the upper & tallest cliff band. Less than 200- feet hiking up the ramp there is a rock art panel with two large pictographs & a petroglyph on your left (west) side. Please do not touch & only take pictures. Most parties miss the this panel of rock art. Follow the direction of the upper cliff band west past a large W cliff formation that extends from the wall (N38° 33' 14\", W110° 58' 07\"). From there hike south down into the upper wash of The Squeeze (N38° 32' 57\", W110° 58' 11\"). Any cliffs or drops on the way to the wash can usually be overcome by backtracking and finding a ramp on your right (west) side. There are no additional rappels required when accessing The Squeeze using the Miner's Approach. But you will be treated to more narrows, downclimbs, wading and swimming depending on water levels. The complete Miners Approach route from Airstrip to Airstrip will take a small experienced group approximately 10 to 12 hours.

The San Rafael River has carved a deep narrow slot canyon into the heart of the San Rafael Swell. The Coconino sandstone walls are 400 feet high and in places only 25 feet wide. Canyoneering this route involves several miles of wading and swimming. Getting through the Upper Black Box is an exciting and entertaining adventure. The San Rafael Swell is one of the most primitive and rugged areas in the lower 48 states. This also means that you must be self-reliant, plan ahead and use good judgment. Emergency Service, help or rescue is not close by or easily obtained. The Black Box can be deadly and should be taken seriously. General Information: Upper Black Box is a water filled slot canyon that requires complete technical gear. This canyon is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is approximately 4 hours. Upper Black Box is rated 3C II using the Canyon Rating System. This route is usually done from late spring through fall, early summer appears to be the ideal time to complete this route. Under normal conditions you will encounter several long swims and almost constant wading. Wetsuits are typically used in all but the warmest weather. You will be wet and in the water for approximately 3 hours, hypothermia is a serious danger. On the drive to the trailhead you will have the opportunity to check the water temperature and the streamflow. This canyon has a high flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. The hike requires good weather, 80 degree plus temperatures, and river flow rates less than 75 cubic feet per second. Visit USGS real-time streamflow conditions for the San Rafael River. The entrance rappel into the canyon is 145-feet and requires two 150-foot ropes. For those that don't mind some very easy downclimbing the entrance rappel shrinks to 115-feet and can easily be completed with two 120-foot ropes. Some advise leaving your rope hanging at the first rappel and retrieving it at the end of the day. I consider this poor advise for several reasons, the main one being the canyon is not that long and it's more trouble to retrieve your rope then it is to carry it through the canyon with you. Additional gear should consist of dry bags, 50-feet of webbing, a couple rapid links and a prusik system. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Devils Hole\" and \"Mexican Mountain\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for the Upper Black Box Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: The Upper Black Box does not require a vehicle shuttle. The trailhead is accessible to high clearance vehicles in normal conditions, four wheel drive is not required. This area is criss- crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Price Utah - Take Highway 6 Exit #241 and drive south on Highway 10 for 28 miles to mile marker 39.5, where you will find a well maintained gravel road on the east (left) side of the road. This is where you enter the San Rafael Swell. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/ubb.htm 1/25/2018 Upper Black Box - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 From Castle Dale Utah - Take Highway 10 north for 1.5 miles to mile marker 39.5, where you will find a well maintained gravel road on the east (right) side of the road. This is where you enter the San Rafael Swell. From where you enter the San Rafael Swell (N39° 13' 15\", W110 ° 59' 51\") follow the well maintained gravel road east. The road is signed Buckhorn Wash. Follow the road east for 15.1 miles to the signed Buckhorn Wash turnoff (N39° 10' 15\", W110 ° 45' 03\"). Turn south (right) and follow the Buckhorn Wash road south for 9.6 miles to a cattle guard and the signed Mexican Mountain Road (N39° 04' 58\", W110 ° 39' 52\") on the east (left) side of the road. At this point it is in your best interest to visit the bridge over the San Rafael River that is visible 100-yards to your south. At the bridge you can walk down to the river and check the streamflow and water temperature. Follow the Mexican Mountain Road east, through the campground, and drive 13.9 miles to the Upper Black Box Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to recognize as it is just a large parking area. The Mexican Mountain Road ends 150-yards further east at a BLM gate so you can't miss the trailhead. There is reasonable primitive camping available at the trailhead. It's not a place I would pick for a great campsite, but if you are pulling in late and just looking for a place to spend the night is more than adequate. Route Information: From the Upper Black Box Canyon Trailhead (N39° 00' 51\", W110° 29' 25\"), hike west on the road you drove in on for 1/4 mile to a prominent side canyon on the south (left) side of the road (N39° 00' 39\", W110° 29' 33\"). Scramble down to the bottom of the side canyon and follow it south for 1/4 mile to where it joins the Upper Black Box. At this junction you want to downclimb the side canyon as far as possible. This is accomplished using some ledges and cracks on the west (right) side of the side canyon. The downclimbing is never difficult or dangerous. After downclimbing approximately half the vertical distance to the river you will be stopped on a large platform. There are two bolts with a chain (N39° 00' 32\", W110° 29' 24\") located on the west (right) canyon wall. The rappel is 145-feet (or 115-feet plus some easy downclimbing at the bottom). The rappel deposits you on top of what some call the rock fall. This is where you want to put on your wetsuits and drybag your gear. Scramble down from the top of the rock fall into the river and begin swimming, hiking and wading downstream. The route is pretty simple and straight forward the rest of the way. The biggest challenge from here on that you might encounter are sections of deep mud. Near the end of the canyon the canyon walls become lower and constrict to create one last memorable swim. The finish of the Upper Black Box is pretty dramatic as the high canyon walls just end (N39° 00' 57\", W110° 28' 44\"), and the river is released from the confines of the Upper Black Box. This is also your exit, and you will instantly know it when you reach it. Simply hike north (left) 1/4 mile and interest the old section of the Mexican Mountain Road that is now closed (N39° 01' 05\", W110° 28' 58\"). Once you intersect the old road it's an easy 3/4 mile hike west (left) to the trailhead.

414 Zero Gravity - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 1 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Zero Gravity AKA: Zero-G San Rafael Swell Technical Canyoneering Zero Gravity is a great little slot canyon that packs a very large punch. Those attempting the route will certainly get their money's worth. Swimming, squeezing and downclimbing are all part of the package of this little gem. General Information: If you enjoy swimming, squeezing and downclimbing this is the route for you. Zero Gravity requires complete technical gear. Fall and spring are the preferred seasons to do this route. But with a short approach and plenty of water this route will also be pleasant in summer. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. The canyon might require one or two short rappels. Experienced canyoneers can downclimb the entire route. A 60-foot rope is required for handlines, pothole escapes, lowering of backpacks and possible rappels. This is a physical technical canyon and requires moderate climbing skills and technique. The amount of fun to be had in this canyon is highly water dependant. The more water in the canyon the more fun you will have. In normal conditions this canyon holds a large amount of water. Several sections of swimming and long sections of wading are required. Full wetsuits are required in spring and fall with shorties being acceptable during the hot summer months. Dry suits are not advised because of the downclimbing and squeezing involved with the route. The route contains one 9-foot deep keeper pothole that two people should be able to easily escape with a pack toss or partner assist. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 3 to 4 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Arsons Garden\" and \"Greasewood Draw\" are essential. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps for Zero Gravity use the WGS84 datum. Zero Gravity is rated 3B R II using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Zero Gravity Name: How did Zero Gravity get it's name? The first time we canyoneered the slot I dropped through the exit bomb bay a little too early and became wedged between the canyon walls. I was stuck at my chest, but my feet were hanging down into space about 10-feet above the ground. I was suspended in air and looked like Wily E. Coyote running in space, or zero gravity. After my friends finished laughing and making fun of my predicament they helped me escape the trap. Trailhead Information: Zero Gravity is located in Emery County between the towns of Green River and Hanksville. From Green River, Utah follow I-70 west for 11 miles to Exit #149 and Highway 24. Follow Highway 24 south for 13 miles to mile marker #147. Turn west on the good dirt road. Follow the dirt road 1.6 miles to a point where you encounter a heavy thicket of tamarisk and the dirt road crosses Iron Wash. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/zero.htm 1/25/2018 Zero Gravity - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 After crossing Iron Wash the road splits, you can take the road of least resistance because the roads rejoin on top of the hill. After crossing Iron Wash you must drive an additional 0.8 miles to where the road crosses a shallow wash. This is the trailhead for Zero Gravity. The trailhead is identified by a blocked off 4x4 track heading west on the south side of the wash. For those interested the dirt road continues 1.3 miles to the Eardley Canyon Trailhead. There are several nice primitive campsites located at the Eardley Canyon Trailhead. High clearance vehicles should have no problem reaching the Zero Gravity Trailhead. Low clearance vehicles might be stopped near the Iron Wash crossing. If you are stopped just park where convenient and walk the short distance to the actual trailhead. Route Information: From the Zero Gravity Trailhead (N38° 46' 31\", W110° 29' 00\") hike west and follow the faint 4x4 track. If you can follow the 4x4 track it makes the first part of the approach really easy. If you lose the 4x4 track just follow the south rim of Zero Gravity. No matter that route you use, 1 1/4 miles after leaving the trailhead you will encounter a cross-cut wash that allows easy access to the bottom of Zero Gravity. Hike to the bottom of Zero Gravity and visit the two small natural bridges that we call Tinky Winky (N38° 46' 13\", W110° 30' 20\"). The first thin narrow bridge over the pool of water is Tinky and 50 feet further up canyon is a thick natural bridge that we call Winky. In this area there are several side canyons that are fun to explore. From the natural bridge Tinky just begin hiking down canyon. Almost immediately you will reach the first obstacle, which is a big pool protected by a narrow slot. You can chimney over this pool, or downclimb and swim through the pool. Continue strolling down canyon and you will enter more narrows with a pool guarding the bottom. We refer to this pool as the 1st swim because this pool usually requires a short swim to cross. You can jump into the pool if someone has swam across and checked the landing area. After the 1st swim continue hiking down canyon. Enjoy a long section of usually dry narrows, with pools that can be waded or circumvented. Eventually you will reach the 2nd swim. This is a large deep pool that you can downclimb into. This pool is a blast to jump into provided a member of your party has swam across and checked the landing area. If the pool is clean and the weather is warm this pool becomes an ideal swimming hole. After exiting the 2nd swim you have a really short hike before encountering the 3rd swim. Hmmm.... this is starting to sound like a lot of swimming. After the 3rd swim the canyon becomes more adult. Up to this point the canyon has offered several escapes but from here on that option will be eliminated. The canyon deepens and the sides narrow up. Continue down canyon and you will reach a very narrow section that drops into a 9- foot deep keeper pothole. The pothole can be defeated solo by a gifted climber. All others will require a partner assist or a pack toss to exit. Immediately after the keeper pothole you will encounter a downclimb into a second pothole, followed by a long narrow hallway type section that is referred to as the 4th swim or hallway swim. This is probably the most beautiful and exciting part of the canyon. You will be swimming and wading through a narrow slot. After the hallway swim the canyon opens up slightly one more time and then pinches down for the exit. As you near the exit you will note a large chockstone wedged between the canyon walls. The sooner you recognize the exit and chockstone the easier it is to chimney to the top of the chockstone, which is the best place to be. From the top of the exit chockstone you can survey the final obstacles and make a couple of important decisions. Here is how it works out. Skinny canyoneers can squeeze down behind the exit chockstone, into a narrow slot, and easily downclimb into the exit pool better known as the 5th swim. This is the best method, provided you don't get stuck. Be honest about your diet as this option is really only suitable for smurf-sized canyoneers. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/zero.htm 1/25/2018 Zero Gravity - San Rafael Swell - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 Warning: The squeeze under the chockstone is much narrower than it appears. More than one canyoneer has become wedged in this squeeze and required rescue, which usually takes about 12 hours. If you have any doubt about the squeeze you will want to go over the top of the chockstone and rappel out of the bomb bay. I am 6' tall, weigh 180 pounds, and I always take the high road. Size is not an issue with this slot canyon provided you take the high road to exit. You have been warned! Medium and Large frame canyoneers must climb over the front of the exit chockstone until they can find a place wide enough to fit through and reach the canyon floor. The problem with going over the top is you squeeze through a narrow section and drop out of what climbers call a bomb bay. There is currently a bolt located above the chockstone which makes protecting this option easier then in years past. If in doubt about your size this is the recommended option. Most canyoneers will want to set up a short rappel using the bolt as an anchor, climb out the slot until you are positive you will fit through the narrow gap and drop through the bomb bay. If you have a skinny canyoneer that took the low road spot you from below it makes things easier. Warning: Do not attempt to drop through the bomb bay to early. More than one canyoneer has required rescue by becoming wedged in this slot by not stemming out far enough before attempting to drop through the bomb bay. You have been warned! After everyone has defeated the exit chockstone and bomb bay obstacle you can easily downclimb into the exit pool and enjoy the 5th swim. After that just hike a short distance down canyon to the trailhead. HD Video: This video was shot over Memorial Day weekend in 2011.

Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Boltergeist Silver Reef Technical Canyoneering Sometime around 2001 I was told about a nice short canyon named \"Boltergeist\". Since this information came from the same person who uncovered and told me about Yankee Doodle I was excited to try Boltergeist, after all, Yankee Doodle is a little sweet heart.... but it took me seven years to finally get around to doing the Boltergeist route. And the verdict? It's no Yankee Doodle. It's a nice canyon and it does have a few redeeming qualities. It combines with Yankee Doodle for a nice combo platter, and when combined with Yankee Doodle it could make for a great classroom canyon as it involves some nice basic natural anchors and a sweet little downclimb/chimney. There is flowing water along the route which is also welcome in the desert. This is a nice canyon to try if you are in the area, but I would not consider it a destination canyon as I would it's sister canyon, Yankee Doodle. General Information: Boltergeist is best described as short and amusing. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 2 hours. Boltergeist requires complete technical gear. The scenery is pleasant and lush. Boltergeist is rated 3A I using the Canyon Rating System. You might encounter a very short waist deep wade and you will always have ankle deep wading. Wetsuits are not required. The longest rappel in the canyon is approximately 150-feet. Two 165-foot ropes are more then adequate. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is very useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Signal Peak\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Boltergeist use the WGS84 datum. This route has a minor flashflood danger. A quick look to the sky before entering this canyon should be sufficient. This route is located outside of Zion National Park and a backcountry permit is not required. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchors and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Cryptobiotic Soil: Follow the route described and you will avoid most areas of cryptobiotic crust. Please avoid disturbing all cryptobiotic crust. Stay on existing trails, walk in wash bottoms or on slickrock. Go out of your way, literally, to avoid cryptobiotic soil. Cryptobiotic crust requires years of undisturbed growth before it becomes visible as an irregular, blackish mat on the soil surface. A single footprint by a careless hiker can destroy years of growth. Trailhead Information: The Boltergeist Trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in normal weather conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/bolter.htm 1/25/2018 Boltergiest - Silver Reef - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Southbound I-15: Take the Leads Exit #23. The off ramp deposits you on the Silver Reef Road. Northbound I-15: Take the Leads Exit #22. Drive 1.5 miles, through the town of leads, to the Sliver Reef Road. Use the under-pass to cross beneath I-15. From the I-15 exit/underpass (N37° 14' 40\", W113° 21'12\"), follow the paved Sliver Reef Road west as it meanders through a housing development, shortly past the housing development the road turns to gravel. From I-15 it is 3.1 miles to a fork in the road (N37° 16' 16\", W113° 23' 12\"). The north (right) fork leads to the Oak Grove Campground. Take the south (left) fork. From the fork follow the well-maintained gravel road for an additional 3.7 miles to a small spur road (N37° 15' 03\", W113° 25' 58\") on the east (left), drive down the Spur Road 150-yards and park anywhere. This is the Boltergeist Trailhead. If you are having trouble locating the small Spur Road it is helpful to know it's 0.4 miles south of the cattle guard/gate as you exit the ranch. There is so-so primitive camping available along the Spur Road. Route Information: From the Boltergeist Trailhead (N37° 15' 01\", W113° 25' 52\") walk southeast for 100 yards to where you can scramble down to the bottom of the canyon. This is the beginning of Boltergeist (N37° 14' 58\", W113° 25' 51\"). From here head downstream and enjoy the fun. After several short dryfalls and several easily downclimbs you will come to a 30-foot drop. The rappel anchor is a tree, or you can walk round the feature using a ledge system on the west (left) side. You make the call. Next you will encounter a tight 30-foot downclimb/chimney. Canyoneer size should not be an issue as large frames fit higher up with no problem. Novice canyoneers might require a handline for this downclimb, which is easy to rig from an overhead logjam. The downclimb is easier then it first appears. Immediately past the downclimb/chimney you will encounter a 35-foot rappel anchored from a large tree. This is an attractive rappel as it follows a curving dryfall. A few short steps brings you to anther rappel. This one is 30-feet and is anchored by a chokestone. This rappel requires a bit of a rodeo (awkward) start. There is a small pothole at the bottom of this rappel, when full of water the pothole is waist deep. Those with skill can easily stem or bridge the small pothole. I understand that the pothole is usually empty unless it has rained recently. As you near the bottom of the canyon you encounter the final rappel. This rappel is approximately 150-feet and anchored by a large tree. Most of this rappel is free hanging. The last person down this rappel should take care to position the ropes for a smooth pull, it would be easy to stick a rope here and a little effort to begin will help you avoid a headache later. From the bottom of the final rappel scramble to the east (right) to the canyon bottom (N37° 15' 04\", W113° 25' 40\"). Once in the canyon bottom you will encounter a flowing stream. Hike up canyon for 300 yards following the stream. The hike up canyon is a challenging bushwhack keep your feet dry type of experience. You will pass several cascades as you hike up stream, 50- yards after passing a nice little waterfall you will notice a steep rocky/brushy slope on the west (left) side. This is the canyon exit (N37° 15' 12\", W113° 25'36\"). Ascend this short but very steep slope using your best route finding skills. Once you have gained the top of the ridge it is a short 1/4 mile walk south, back to your car. If you keep your eyes open you will discover an ATV track that will make the short hike back easier and help you avoid Cryptobiotic Soil.

This is a short and sweet slot canyon located just outside of Zion National Park. The canyon is strikingly beautiful and photogenic. This canyon is proof that good things come in small packages. General Information: Hidden Star is best described as fast and fun. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 2 hours. Hidden Star requires complete technical gear. The scenery is spectacular. Hidden Star is rated 3B I using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon is suitable for beginners with competent leadership. Water in the canyon can fluctuate drastically, in normal conditions expect some wading to waist deep. The canyon has the ability to hold a lot of water in wet weather and has been known to require short sections of swimming. In hot weather wetsuits are not required. If current conditions are unknown and the day is chilly than wetsuits are advised. You will need two ropes to complete this canyon. The longest rappel in the canyon is 180- feet and requires a 185-foot rope. You will leave this rope hanging to avoid creating rope grooves and retrieve it on your return. You will also require a 120-foot rope to defeat obstacles in the canyon. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. This canyon contains an easy to defeat keeper pothole. Often I will bump the rating for a keeper pothole, but this one should not be a problem for anyone that is aware of its existence. It's possible to stem over the top of the pothole but a fall comes with major penalty points. It's much easier to use a straightforward pack toss or pot shot to defeat this problem. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Harrisburg Junction\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate and involves hiking cross-country. All waypoints and maps for Hidden Star use the WGS84 datum. This route has a minor flashflood danger. A quick look to the sky before entering this canyon should be sufficient. No permits are required for completing this route. Trailhead Information: The Hidden Star Trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in normal weather conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Southbound I-15: Take the Leads Exit #23. The off ramp deposits you on the Silver Reef Road. Northbound I-15: Take the Leads Exit #22.

From I-15 it is 3.1 miles to a fork in the road (N37° 16' 16\", W113° 23' 12\"). The north (right) fork leads to the Oak Grove Campground. Take the south (left) fork. From the fork follow the well-maintained gravel road for an additional 7.3 miles to Spur Road #903 http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/hiddenstar.htm 1/25/2018 Hidden Star - Silver Reef - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 (N37° 14' 05\", W113° 28' 38\") on the left (south). Follow Spur Road #903 south for 0.4 miles to the Hidden Star Trailhead. There is nothing special to identify the trailhead and it's not really that critical. Just find a good place to pull off the road and park. You will pass several nice primitive campsites on the lower Silver Reef Road, as you near the trailhead the campsites become very poor and are few and far between. Route Information: From the Hidden Star Trailhead (N37° 13' 51\", W113° 28' 25\"), Hike cross-country in a west-southwest direction for 1/2 mile to a slickrock drainage and the top of Hidden Star Canyon (N37° 13' 38\", W113° 28' 54\"). Make sure you are entering the correct drainage. If you enter the wrong drainage just to the east you be presented with a boring bushwhack to the exit. Hike a short distance downstream and you will encounter the first rappel, which is 180-feet and anchored from a deadman (pile of rocks) in a pothole. This rappel drops over a couple of potholes and through some narrows. Please do not pull your rappel rope, but instead leave it hanging to avoid creating rope grooves. The exit route brings you back to the top of this rappel where you can easily retrieve your rope. As a side benefit you don't have to carry a bunch of extra weight through the canyon. At the base of the first rappel do not drop into the watercourse. Instead look for a shelf on the left (south) side of the canyon. Walk out this shelf for 75-yards to a small cedar tree (please be nice to this tree). This self will allow you to avoid bushwhacking through some thick vegetation. The second rappel is 40-feet and anchored from the small cedar tree. From the bottom of the second rappel hike downstream through a series of potholes. The last pothole in the series is considered a keeper pothole and is typically defeated with a pack toss or pot shot. Exit the keeper pothole and hike a short distance to the final 20-foot downclimb, which might be a rappel for some. At the 20-foot downclimb there is a large drainage entering from the right (north). This is not the exit route. Continue hiking downstream 100-yards to a second large drainage entering from the right (north). This is the start of the exit route (N37° 13' 32\", W113° 29' 02\"). Hike to the top of the drainage, retrieve the rappel rope you left earlier, and return to the trailhead.

The canyon is strikingly beautiful and photogenic. This canyon is proof that good things come in small packages. The canyon is often used as a classroom by local guides and canyoneering schools. General Information: Yankee Doodle is best described as short and sweet. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 2 hours. Yankee Doodle requires complete technical gear. The scenery is spectacular. Yankee Doodle is rated 3B I using the Canyon Rating System. Water in the canyon can fluctuate drastically, in normal conditions expect some wading to waist deep. The canyon has the ability to hold a lot of water in wet weather and has been known to require short sections of swimming. In hot weather wetsuits are not required, even in wet weather. If current conditions are unknown and the day is chilly than wetsuits are advised. The longest rappel in the canyon is 70-feet and requires a 150-foot rope. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Harrisburg Junction\" are essential. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps for Yankee Doodle use the WGS84 datum. This route has a minor flashflood danger. A quick look to the sky before entering this canyon should be sufficient. No permits are required for completing this route. This route combines well with Boltergiest to create a pleasant day of canyoneering in Silver Reef. If you can only do one canyon I consider Yankee Doodle to be the biggest bang for the buck. Optional Entrance Rappel: Some people enjoy big rappels, if that is you it's nice to know the entrance rappel can be rigged as a 170-foot free hanging rappel. The anchor is two easy to located bolts on the north rim of the canyon. If doing the big air entrance it's typical to leave your rope hanging and retrieve it at the end of the route. If using this option you will want to carry a 30-foot rope through the canyon with you to defeat other obstacles. Trailhead Information: The Yankee Doodle Trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in normal weather conditions. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. Southbound I-15: Take the Leads Exit #23. The off ramp deposits you on the Silver Reef Road. Northbound I-15: Take the Leads Exit #22.

Route Information: From the Yankee Doodle Trailhead (N37° 14' 15\", W113° 27' 09\") walk south down the road 50-yards to where a small wash crosses the road. Follow the small wash east for 50-yards to where the bottom falls out of the wash into a small slot canyon. This is the west prong of Yankee Doodle (N37° 14' 11\", W113° 27' 11\"). There is also a south prong if you want to check it out or use it for a second lap of the canyon. The easiest method of entering the west prong is to hike down the south (right) side of the west prong for 100-feet to where a chimney allows you to downclimb to the bottom of the slot. If downclimbing the chimney isn't your cup of tea just set up a 20-foot rappel at the head of the slot. You can anchor a 20-foot rappel from a chokestone in the watercourse, or from a tree on the south rim of the prong. The west prong joins the main canyon at a beautifully fluted 70-foot rappel. For the highly skill this is the only mandatory rappel in Yankee Doodle. The rappel is anchored by two bolts on the north (left) canyon wall. Canyoneer your way down the slot and enjoy the ride. From the bottom of the mandatory 70-foot rappel the remainder of the canyon will contain several downclimbs of varying degrees of difficultly, those less skilled will want to rappel the more difficult downclimbs. Expect to encounter some wading as you work your way down the obstacle course. After a fun filled adventure you will pop out of the slot and in a very short distance discover that Yankee Doodle tees into a large west to east drainage. From the canyon junction back up Yankee Doodle for 50-yards to a gully entering from the west. From the gully back up Yankee Doodle an additional 30-yards to a large crack in the sandstone entering from the west. This is the Yankee Doodle Exit (N37° 14' 09\", W113° 26' 52\"), which is often marked with a rock cairn. Friction up the slickrock on the south (left) side of the crack, using the minor ledges as required. The idea is to climb up the sandstone and then enter the small wash above the crack. Once in the wash above the crack just hike up the wash to where it meets the dirt road. Hike 150- yards south on the road back to the Yankee Doodle Trailhead. This route is short and sweet. Canyon Name: This slot canyon received its name because it is a tributary of Yankee Doodle Hollow as noted on the USGS maps.

This amazing rock art panel is hidden inside a cave in the Stansbury Mountains. General Information: Red Man of Timpie Valley is a majestic single warrior standing guard in a lonely cave. The pictograph is accessible year round in good weather. Spring, winter and fall are the ideal times for this hike. A round trip hike to visit the pictograph requires approximately 90 minutes, depending on how much exploring you do while in the area. The route is 1/4 mile each way with 450-feet of elevation gain. There is no trail and sections of the route involve steep hiking. Every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of one liter of water. A flashlight might prove useful in exploring the Red man Cave, the actual rock art is located near the entrance and a flashlight is not required. A GPS is useful in locating pictograph. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Flux\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Red Man Pictograph is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: The trailhead is normally accessible to all vehicles in dry weather conditions. A high clearance vehicle is preferred for the last 1/2 mile, which can easily be walked. The area is criss- crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Salt Lake City take I-80 west and drive 36 miles towards Grantsville. Take the second Grantsville Exit #84. Follow State Road 138 and the signs south towards Grantsville. 3.1 miles from the I-80 exit turn west (right) onto Ellerbeck Road. Follow Ellerbeck Road west for 2.6 miles to a gravel road heading south (N40° 42' 28\", W112° 34' 53\"). Turn south (left) onto the gravel road and follow it for 1.3 miles to where a smaller dirt road forks off to the south (N40° 42' 27\", W112° 36' 17\"). Turn south (left) and follow the smaller dirt road for 0.6 miles to a place where you can easily pull to the side of the road. This is the Red Man Pictograph Trailhead. There is nothing special to identify the trailhead other than it's a place to pull to the side of the road. Route Information: From the Red Man Pictograph of Timpie Valley Trailhead (N40° 42' 06\", W112° 36' 35\") look southwest. You will see a mountain with three obvious large caves roughly arranged vertically on the mountain, bottom, middle and top. The Red Man Pictograph (N40° 42' 00\", W112° 36' 46\") is in the middle cave. It's a 1/4 mile hike to the cave with 450' of elevation gain. There is no trail to follow. It is interesting to explore all three caves as native Americans inhabited all three at one time or anther, which is obvious from the caves smoked stained ceilings.

This amazing collection of native American rock art requires only a short hike and the trailhead is located 40 minutes from Salt Lake City, which makes this the perfect afternoon adventure for the entire family. General Information: Stansbury Island Petroglyphs contain numerous panels of rock art. The petroglyphs are accessible year round in good weather. Spring, winter and fall are the ideal times for this hike. The island can be very hot and buggy in the summer. Stansbury Island Petroglyphs are rated 1A II using the Canyon Rating System. A round trip hike to visit the petroglyphs at Site #1 requires approximately 2 hours. Visiting Site #2 requires an additional 2 hours. This will allow a reasonable amount of time to explore. The more you explore the more petroglyphs you will uncover. Every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of one liter of water. A GPS is extremely useful in locating petroglyphs. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Plug Peak \" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy and follows a trail most of the way. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: The trailhead is normally accessible to all vehicles in dry weather conditions. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From Salt Lake City take I-80 west and drive 36 miles towards Grantsville. Take the second Grantsville Exit #84. Turn west (left) and follow the all weather Stansbury Island road 4.0 miles northward through the evaporation ponds to a fork in the road. Turn northeast (right) and follow the road 0.4 miles to a fork in the road. Turn north (left) and follow the road 1.1 miles to where a rough dirt road leads to the north (left). All vehicles should be able to reach this junction in all weather, the road can turn rough and muddy from this point on depending on recent weather conditions. Some might want to walk from this point on. From the junction with the rough dirt road turn north (left) and follow the dirt road for 0.6 miles to where a gate and boulders block the road. This is the Stansbury Island Petroglyph Trailhead. There is an old dilapidated \"No Trespassing\" sign located at the trailhead, I have no clue who the property belongs to or if it is legal to access the property. I have visited the petroglyph's several times and never been bothered, but it is possible you could be trespassing. You have been warned. Route Information: From the Stansbury Island Petroglyph Trailhead (N40° 46' 49\", W112° 29' 28\"), cross the gate and follow the old road northeast. The road you want to follow parallels the canal on your east (right) side, do not follow the road that braches northwest (left) towards the canyon. Follow the old road north for 1 mile and you will reach a road junction. At the road junction you will notice a prominent ridge of rocks that leads directly north from the junction. The Site #1 http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/stansbury.htm 1/25/2018 Stansbury Island Petroglyphs - Hiking & Rock Art Page 2 of 2 Petroglyphs (N40° 47' 23\", W112° 28' 47\"), are located along the complete length of the ridge. The largest concentration of rock art is located approximately midway up the ridge in a large rock out cropping. We have visited Site #1 several times and always find something new that we missed on previous visits. There are literally hundreds of petroglyphs at this location. To reach Site #2 Petroglyphs keep following the road north paralleling the canal on your east (right) side. After 1 mile the canal will end at a pumping station. Follow the road north from the pumping station for an additional 1/2 mile to where the road rounds a rocky point. Site #2 Petroglyphs (N40° 48' 14\", W112° 28' 25\") are located on top of the rocky point. The site is easiest to access if you hike around to the north side of the rocky point and climb to the top heading south. The site consists of a couple dozen petroglyphs, many of which are found on top of the rocks facing skyward. History: Stansbury Island is the second largest island within the Great Salt Lake, it is considered an island even though a dirt causeway connects it to the mainland. Stansbury Island was named after Howard Stansbury, the leader of a government expedition that surveyed the lake in 1851.

Feedback ] [ Updates ] Maidenwater Canyon Trachyte Creek Technical Canyoneering Maidenwater Canyon is a fun; physically demanding and technically challenging adventure. The beauty of this canyon is spectacular; the narrows are exciting, unyielding and treacherous. This canyon places a high premium on teamwork. The canyon offers a variety of routes from beginner to expert. Maidenwater Canyon drains the eastern slopes of Mount Hillers. The canyon offers its enchantment with only a short approach hike from a major highway. A stylish descent requires moderate rock climbing skills. Interested in viewing a short video, which was shot in the Middle Fork of Maidenwater Canyon? *Maidenwater Video* General Information: Maidenwater Canyon is an amazing technical canyoneering adventure. Good rock climbing skills are a bonus. Maidenwater Canyon requires complete technical gear. The canyon contains wading in normal conditions with the possibility of several short swims required in wet conditions. A wetsuit might be required in extremely wet or cold conditions. The canyon is easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. The rappels in this canyon are all less than 30 feet but a 100-foot rope is required because several of the natural anchors are located back from the edge of the rappel. Additional gear should consist of a half dozen shoulder length slings, several double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappelling. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Hundreds of canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which is not difficult in this canyon. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchor and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. I strongly suggest a long sleeve shirt and long pants for this slot or you will leave some skin on the canyon walls. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Black Table\" are essential. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger. Check the local weather report before committing. Hiking Variation: Hikers will be interested in the non-technical varation of this canyon known as Lower Maidenwater Canyon. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/maid.htm 1/25/2018 Maidenwater - Trachyte Creek - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Middle Fork Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 26 miles to the signed turn-off to State Road 276 and Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell. Follow State Road 276 south for 9 miles to mile marker 9.0. There is a small pull-out on the east side of the road just north of the drainage. This is the trailhead. South Fork Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 26 miles to the signed turn-off to State Road 276 and Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell. Follow State Road 276 south for just over 9 miles to mile marker 9.4. There is a small pull-out on the east side of the road just south of the drainage. This is the trailhead. Middle Fork Route Information: The Middle Fork of Maidenwater is the easiest of the options. If you have any question about your abilities this is the preferred route. If you find the Middle Fork difficult than do not enter the South Fork, if you find this route fun and entertaining than step up to big brother next door. I recommend a group size of 6 or less. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 3 to 4 hours. This is a physical canyon requiring constant downclimbing, wading, stemming and chimneying. There should be no swimming required in this canyon unless it has been exceptionally wet. Good rock climbing skills are a bonus. The Middle Fork of Maidenwater Canyon is rated 3B II using the Canyon Rating System. From the Middle Fork Trailhead (N37° 54' 03\", W110° 34' 20\"), walk south on the road for 1/4 mile and than hike west up the ridge separating the South Fork from the Middle Fork of Maidenwater. The route is easiest if you stay on the highest ridgeline separating the two canyons until you met a cliff band that will force you to choose your drainage. From the point where the cliff band forces you to pick a drainage (N37° 53' 44\", W110° 35' 01\"), traverse north under a cliff that looks like a ship prow (with a little imagination) and easily descend to the bottom of the Middle Fork of Maidenwater (N37° 54' 02\", W110° 35' 10\"). The approach hike should require about one hour with moderate route finding over slickrock. After reaching the bottom of Middle Fork of Maidenwater start hiking downstream. The first obstacle you encounter is a 70-foot dryfall over a rotten cliff band. This obstacle should be bypassed by traversing 75 yards down canyon on the right side (LDC) and than enjoy a short scramble to the canyon bottom. From this point on it is impossible to get lost. Just continue down canyon and enjoy the fun. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that most the obstacles can be over come with teamwork, intelligence and climbing skills. This canyon is often descended by experienced canyoneers using as few as one or two rappels. Others will require five or six rappels. In normal conditions the canyon contains only knee deep wading that can often be avoided with a little skill and technique. Make certain you take a moment at the canyon exit to admire the method the road building crew used to bridge the deep slot canyon. As an engineer I found this technique very ingenious, cost effective and simple. However, it might not be the most environmentally sensitive bridging method available. South Fork Route Information: The South Fork of Maidenwater is the more difficult of the two options. I recommend a group size of 4 or less because of the large number of problems that cascade into one anther. The South Fork is similar to the Middle Fork with the exception of the obstacles, which come at you in a large rapid-fire dosage. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 5 to 6 hours. This is a very physical canyon requiring constant downclimbing, wading, stemming, chimneying and the possibility of a short swim near the finish. Good rock climbing skills are a bonus. The South Fork of Maidenwater Canyon is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/maid.htm 1/25/2018 Maidenwater - Trachyte Creek - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 From the South Fork Trailhead (N37° 53' 41\", W110° 34' 11\"), hike north on the road for 100 yards and than hike west up the ridge separating the South Fork from the Middle Fork of Maidenwater. The route is easiest if you stay on the highest ridgeline separating the two canyons until you met a cliff band that will force you to choose your drainage. From the point where the cliff band forces you to pick a drainage (N37° 53' 44\", W110° 35' 01\"), traverse south until you can see the head of the South Fork of Maidenwater. The approach hike should require about one hour with moderate route finding over slickrock. After reaching the obvious head of South Fork of Maidenwater you will want to rim walk down the south side of the canyon for approximately 150 yards to a chimney (N37° 53' 31\", W110° 35' 42\") that allows you to scramble to the bottom of the canyon. From this point on it is almost impossible to get lost. Just continue down canyon and enjoy the fun. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that most the obstacles can be over come with good teamwork, intelligence and climbing skills. This canyon is often descended by experienced canyoneers in as few as 5 or 6 rappels. Others will require considerably more rappels. In normal conditions the canyon contains only knee to waist deep wading until you are in sight of State Road 276 near the exit where you might encounter a short swim through a deep pool. Make certain you take a moment at the canyon exit to admire the method the road building crew used to bridge the deep slot canyon. As an engineer I found this technique very ingenious, cost effective and simple. However, it might not be the most environmentally sensitive bridging method available. Optional Route Information: Do you think you are a big shot rope gun? What's a rope gun you ask? If you don't know, you are not one, and probably don't even know one. It is possible for a small group of very skilled canyoneers to ascend the Middle Fork and descend the South Fork. This route will require at least one good climber who can lead unprotected 5.9 with 20 to 30 feet of exposure. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 8 to 9 hours. This option is rated 3B R III using the Canyon Rating System.

Trachyotomy - The delicate procedure of squeezing and clambering through an extremely narrow slot canyon as it winds its way to Trachyte Creek. General Information: Trachyotomy is an eccentric technical canyoneering adventure. This canyon is easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Trachyotomy is rated 3B R III using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 5 to 7 hours. This is a physical canyon requiring downclimbing, wading, swimming, climbing, stemming and chimneying. Bring as small and light of pack as possible. Trachyotomy requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon requires at least one short swim and possible wading. The canyon has the ability to hold water. A wetsuit might be required in extremely wet or cold conditions. A long sleeve shirt and long pants are highly suggested for this slot or you will leave some skin, the sandstone walls are very sharp. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Black Table and Hite North\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for Trachyotomy use the WGS84 datum. The longest rappel is 50-feet and requires a 100-foot rope. The canyon also contains a keeper pothole sometime referred to as \"The Cauldron\", you will require complete pothole escape gear, conditions and difficulty of the pothole change depending on water level. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchor and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 26 miles to the signed turn-off to State Road 276 and Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell. Follow State Road 276 south for 3 1/2 miles to mile marker 3.6. At this point you will encounter a dirt road heading east (N37° 58' 24\", W110° 34' 05\"). Those with 4 wheel drive can follow the dirt road for 4.0 miles to a Tee in the road (N37° 57' 21\", W110° 30' 34\"). Turn right, and follow the dirt road an additional 0.8 miles to the trailhead. Condition of the dirt road varies. 4 wheel drive vehicles will have no problem accessing this trailhead. High clearance vehicles should be able to reach this trailhead in normal conditions. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/trachyotomy.htm 1/25/2018 Trachyotomy - Trachyte Creek - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Route Information: From the trailhead (N37° 56' 59\", W110° 29' 59\"), you can see into Trachyotomy. Hike east from the trailhead and route find through the rim and into the canyon. The first few sections of narrows are short with some mae westing & possible pools of water that can be stemmed over by the skilled. At the end of the one of these sections is a pothole which can be stepped over with a little technique. The pothole looks like a large donut with a cone in the middle. At the other end of this pothole is an exposed 15-foot downclimb. Using a human anchor to secure a rope, sequence people down, and then spotting the last person down works well. After this the canyon opens up for about 15-30 minutes of open canyon hiking. The canyon narrows up again and gets skinny. Being able to visualize where your hips and shoulders will fit looking down canyon will help you negotiate these narrows easily. If things get too tight you can always climb up 10-15 feet or so where you can stem easily over the tight spots. There is one place near the end that most people will have to climb up a few feet to get over. This section of canyon isn't very long but will take between 30 to 60 minutes to complete depending on group size and how easily you negotiate the narrows. The canyon opens up briefly before reaching the first rappel (N37° 55' 51\" W110° 30' 59\"). The rappel is 37 feet and is anchored by a deadman covered with a large sandstone rock in the middle of the wash. If this anchor washes out there are rocks down canyon that can be ferried back up canyon to create an anchor. This rappel marks the start of the final and technical section of Trachyotomy. The canyon dives deeper and you will immediately encounter a keeper pothole marked by a down climb. The keeper is referred to by some as 'The Cauldron\". Before entering this 12-foot plus deep pothole, you can defeat it with the following strategies. Strategy #1: Create a human anchor near the top of the down climb and have a rope as a handline. Hang onto rope with right hand, smear onto sandy ledge or underwater ledge 4 feet below lip and grab a large open handed pinch with your left hand. Let go of rope in right hand and match to your left on the large openhanded pinch. Shift right foot to sandy ledge or underwater ledge at the same time you place left hand on the opposing exit wall and climb out. These moves are difficult with high penalty points if the pothole is empty. Create a trayoleon traverse to bring everyone over except your last person who will have to take a barn door swing. Strategy #2: Climb up high above the downclimb into the pothole where you can toss your pack down canyon and wedge into a constriction on the other side of the keeper. Throwing a few sand bags or pot shots might work better. Descend into the pothole and climb out. Note that throwing a pack or pot shots will be very difficult or impossible from the bottom of the pothole. The lip on the other side of the pothole is tight and accommodates 2 or 3 canyoneers before a slippery 15-foot downclimb into a mandatory short swim across a small pool in a dark part of the canyon. If you have successfully stayed dry up to the pool, strip down & toss your packs across once the first victim swims to the other side. After the pool the canyon will require climbing up and stemming a short distance down canyon. Those with sharp eyes will spot nice rests every few feet or so. Stem down canyon until you reach a pocket stance at the base of a large chokestone. Climb above this large chokestone. Immediately down canyon from this large chokestone is a smaller chokestone with slings. Even though the next drop can be downclimbed, fix a rope to the slings on the smaller chokestone, this small chokestone is the anchor for the final rappel. Downclimb to a large stance and set your ropes for the final rappel. The rappel is 50-feet total from small chokestone to ground. Rappel into a large alcove which is the end of Trachyotomy. Make sure you test the rope pull before the last person rappels down from the large stance. Hike down canyon a short ways and you will see a large arch with small opening on the northwest (right) side of the canyon. The arch is OK but nothing special. Shortly after passing the arch you will arrive at a sandstone ramp sloping into the canyon on the northwest (right) side (N37° 55' 41\" W110° 31' 07\"). This sandstone ramp is your escape from the canyon. Climb up the sandstone ramp, route finding as required to the rim of the canyon. The hike to the south (right) of high point 5050T (N37° 56' 07\" W110° 31' 05\"). From the high point continue hiking northeast and back to the trailhead. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/trachyotomy.htm 1/25/2018 Trachyotomy - Trachyte Creek - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/trachyotomy.htm 1/25/2018 Trail Canyon - Trachyte Creek - Canyoneering Page 1 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Trail Canyon North Fork Trachyte Creek Technical Canyoneering Trail Canyon is amusing, physically demanding and technically challenging. The narrows are spine tingling and deceitful. Trail Canyon features what is known as a \"Mae West Slot\", which is a slot so narrow that it is impossible to pass through. This feature forces you to climb up and over the obstacle. Trail Canyon drains the eastern slopes of Mount Hillers. The canyon offers its charisma with only a short approach hike from a major highway. Any descent of this canyon requires intermediate or better rock climbing skills. One of my prevalent canyoneering partners considers this canyon the biggest bang per mile he has yet found on the Colorado Plateau. Warning: Every member of your group must be a skilled canyoneer. This canyon could be deadly for beginners, even with advanced leadership. The following description is not a substitute for common sense and experience. Do not underestimate the difficulty of descending this canyon. To safely descend this canyon every member of your group must be able to climb at a level of 5.7 or above. Anyone, who cannot climb at this level, will be trapped in this canyon. You have been warned! Trail Canyon is rated 3B R III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. A rescue in this canyon would be dangerous and extremely difficult. General Information: Trail Canyon is an astounding technical canyoneering adventure. Good rock climbing skills are required. Trail Canyon requires complete technical gear. In normal conditions this canyon requires anything from waist deep wading to short swims. A wetsuit might be required in extremely wet or cold conditions. This canyon is easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Bring as small and light of pack as possible. Mae West canyons also require the use of a \"mae west bunny\" or bunny strap. This is a length or webbing or a daisy chain with a carabiner attached that will allow you to hang your pack from your harness while you chimney, climb and stem above and through the narrow slots. A bunny strap is a must have item. I prefer a daisy chain since it allows much more adjustment in where and how you attach your pack. I recommend a group size of 6 or less. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 5 to 6 hours. This is a physical canyon requiring constant downclimbing, wading, climbing, stemming and chimneying. This canyon has two rappels, the longest being 60 feet. You might encounter additional short rappels depending on your climbing and partner assist skills, a 120-foot rope is required. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/trail.htm 1/25/2018 Trail Canyon - Trachyte Creek - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the drops offer the opportunity to downclimb instead of rappel. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchor and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. I strongly suggest a long sleeve shirt and long pants for this slot or you will leave some skin on the canyon walls. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Black Table\" are essential. You must be certain you are entering the intended drainage or you could encounter major difficulties. Hiking Variation: Hikers will be interested in the non-technical varation of this canyon known as Lower Maidenwater Canyon. Trailhead Information: From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on highway 95 for 26 miles to the signed turn-off to State Road 276 and Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell. Follow State Road 276 south for nearly 10 miles to mile marker 9.9. There is a large pull-out on the west side of the road just south of the drainage. This is the trailhead. Route Information: From the trailhead (N37° 53' 17\", W110° 34' 04\"), note that two washes converge at the culvert passing under Highway 276. Follow the northern wash upstream as it heads west. After walking upstream about 300 yards you will reach a point where two large washes converge (N37° 53' 13\", W110° 34' 17\") and the canyons begin to slot up. The canyon to the North is the North Fork of Trail Canyon. Climb to the top of the ridge separating the two canyons where they begin to slot up. Route find as best you can up the ridge to the top of North Fork of Trail Canyon. This ridge is cross-jointed and requires some intermediate route finding to locate a good path to the top. Just remember there is always an easy and safe way up the ridge if you look around. Consider this part of the adventure and it's more fun. About one hour after you begin hiking you will locate the head of the canyon. The head of the canyon is very distinct and easy to identify. After reaching the obvious head of North Fork of Trail Canyon you will want to rim walk down the south side of the canyon for approximately 100 yards to an easy down climb to the canyon bottom (N37° 53' 16\", W110° 35' 24\"). After reaching the bottom of North Fork of Trail Canyon start hiking downstream. The top of the canyon contains a few minor obstacles as you begin your journey. After a short distance you will encounter the first rappel in the canyon. The rappel anchor is a large cairn at the top of the dryfall. If the canyon has recently flashed it might be necessary to rebuild this cairn before rappelling. The rappel is 60 feet high. From this point on it is impossible to get lost. Just continue down canyon and enjoy the fun. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that most the obstacles can be over come with teamwork, intelligence and climbing skills. Approximately mid-way through the canyon you will encounter the first of three sections of Mae West. Every member of your group will be forced to climb above the extremely narrow slot and chimney or stem to the end of the section. You will be forced 20 feet above the bottom http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/trail.htm 1/25/2018 Trail Canyon - Trachyte Creek - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 of the slot. The Mae West section ends at a drop that must be downclimbed into a pool of water where wading or swimming will be required. As you exit the pool look on the canyon wall to the right (LDC) and you will notice some very faint and very old Moki steps climbing back up to the top of the Mae West section. Wouldn't you love to know the story behind those steps? Frolic down canyon and enjoy the pools, downclimbs and possible short rappels until you exit a deep pool and encounter A 20-foot downclimb leading a few feet to your second Mae West section of canyon. This one is more difficult because you must climb to get on top of it. The climbing is only about 15 feet high to get on top of the Mae West and than 50 feet of chimneying, but this climb can be difficult in wet and muddy shoes. You will be forced about 30 feet above the bottom of the slot. After defeating this obstacle don't start congratulating yourself yet. You must battle the beast one last time. Continue a short distance down canyon and you will encounter the last of the Mae West section of canyon. Really skinny people not wearing wetsuits can fit through the bottom of this one. Do not get trapped in this extremely narrow section of canyon by trying to squeeze through, it could be a fatal mistake. A good indicator of whether you will fit through the bottom is the tight spot at the top of the short downclimb/squeeze into the bottom of the Mae West slot. Explore the tight spot without committing to it; if it seems tight, do not continue forward. You will probably get stuck and rescue could be very difficult or impossible. If there is any doubt than climb up and over this section. Climb above the Mae West until it begins to widen and chimney down canyon 100 yards to freedom. With a little luck you might notice a small ledge running nearly the entire length of this slot right where you need to put your feet. You will be forced about 50 feet above the bottom of the slot at your high point. Yes, it can be a little unnerving. From the end of the third Mae West section it is an enjoyable 1/2 mile stroll back to the trailhead.

General Information: Woodruff Canyon Loop combines two slot canyons popularly known as Woodchuck and Woody into a nice single day adventure. Woodruff Canyon requires complete technical gear. This route is easily accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. Woodruff Canyon Loop is rated 4B R III using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 6 to 8 hours. The canyons can be completed separately for those that desire. If completing the slots separately Woodchuck is rated 3A II and Woody is rated 4B R II using the Canyon Rating System. This route contains numerous partner assists and it is recommended you have a minimum group size of 3 or 4 in a group in order to negotiate obstacles. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Black Table\" and \"Mount Holmes\" are essential. All waypoints and maps for Woodruff Canyon use the WGS84 datum. The longest rappel is 35-feet, but we suggest you carry at least two 100-foot ropes to deal with the monster keeper pothole. You will require complete pothole escape gear, conditions and difficulty of the pothole change depending on water level. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, ibis hook and a prusik system. This canyon has the ability to hold a large amount of water. Wetsuits are required for all but the warmest weather. There are no bolted anchors in this canyon, let's preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. Instead of placing bolts might I suggest teamwork and partner assisted techniques. The problem solving involved with using natural anchor and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Trailhead Information: A vehicle shuttle will eliminate 1.4 miles of road walking at the completion of the Woodruff Canyon Loop. All vehicles can access this trailhead in all weather conditions. From the Utah town of Hanksville drive south on Highway 95 for 26 miles to State Road 276. Turn right (south) towards Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell. Follow State Road 276 south until mile marker 11.8 and park on the east side of the road. This is the Woody Trailhead and where you leave your shuttle vehicle. Now drive back the way you just came for 1.4 miles to mile marker 10.4 and park on the east side of the road. This is the Woodchuck Trailhead. Route Information: From the Woodchuck Trailhead (N37° 52' 53\" W110° 33' 47\") hike southeast to where http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/woody.htm 1/25/2018 Woodruff Canyon - Trachyte Creek - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 there is a break in the canyon rim (N37° 52' 39\" W110° 33' 14\") and you can route find your way down slickrock into the canyon bottom. After a few minutes you will encounter your first drop which is a downclimb into a pothole after which there is a difficult downclimb into another pothole. If you don't want to down climb this it is possible to traverse east (left) and enter the canyon shortly below this. Depending on your choice, continue downstream. You will encounter several more downclimbs where a partner assist may be necessary. Soon you will encounter a 35- foot partially free hanging rappel that exits the slot section. From trailhead to the final rappel should take between 1-2 hours. Hike downstream to the confluence of Woodruff Canyon (N37° 52' 19\" W110° 32' 28\"), turn west (right) and hike upstream. There is vegetation, but the hiking is never too bad with a possible flowing stream in the spring and fall which is enough to get your feet wet. Hike upstream for 3/4 mile to a sand hill (N37° 51' 55\" W110° 33' 02\"). Hike to the top of a sand hill. Once on top it is level with three large distinct slickrock ramps which lead to the canyon rim. Take the east (left) most ramp and hike to the top. Once on the top you must route find your way southwest across several sandstone fins. Once past the fins route find over slickrock and desert to the head of Woody (N37° 51' 21\" W110° 32' 53\"). Head downstream to your first drop. You can get down this 15-foot drop with good partner assist techniques or set up a rappel. The first part of the canyon has potholes but they are easily stemmed over. Soon you will enter a section of canyon with many potholes. It will require good assist technique to get through this section of canyon. One of these is a drop of 15-feet into a pothole, which is not downclimbable. There is a perfect ibis hook placement on the west (left) side in a pocket. Next are two keeper potholes separated by a bridge. If the water is low you can downclimb into the first, crawl under the natural bridge, and then climb or partner assist out. If the water level is in the hard stage you will not be able to crawl under the natural bridge. Instead you will have to sand bag or pack toss from the top of the natural bridge. Shortly after this obstacle is a monster keeper pothole. This monster keeper pothole is the crux of the route. Come prepared with a large bag of pothole escape techniques. Make sure you leave yourself an escape from any keeper pothole until the obstacle has been defeated. If the water level is low it is easy to partner assist out of this pothole. If water is higher it can be difficult. After this the canyon opens up and then another set of tighter narrows is encountered before Woody ends shortly with the final downclimbable drop. Hike up the main fork of Woodruff Canyon to the Woody Trailhead (N37° 51' 58\" W110° 34' 41\"). Before reaching the trailhead you will be able to see your vehicle off in the distance if you parked on the east side of the road.

The area is remote and contains a clear mountain lake, a scenic river through a splendid gorge, and a pleasing waterfall. But best of all, the area contains one of the finest swimming holes to be found on a hot summer day. General Information: Cataract Gorge is an adventure the entire family can enjoy. The day can be no more strenuous than a picnic at the base of a waterfall or spiced up with several hours of hiking, swimming and exploring. The area near the trailhead contains many primitive campsites. The Cataract Gorge region is child friendly with adult supervision. The basic hike through Cataract Gorge requires approximately one hour to complete, but it's very easy to spend an entire day in the area hiking, swimming and exploring. Water is plentiful in this area, but all water taken from lakes and streams should be filtered before drinking. The route contains no real obstacles. Experienced and intermediate hikers will have no problems with this route. Novice hikers will need to pay attention to their map and route description. Afternoon thunderstorms are common in the high Uinta Mountains so go prepared with rain gear. During certain times of the year mosquito's can be a problem in the Uinta's. A mosquito repellent that contains DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is most effective. Navigation for this route is easy. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Mirror Lake\" and \"Iron Mine Mountain\" are helpful. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Use Fee: Visitors who use recreational facilities along State Road 150 (Mirror Lake Highway) are required to pay a use fee. Visitors who do not use recreation facilities, are not subject to fees. Swimming: The best time to swim is from approximately the middle of July to the end of August. The sun shines directly on the swimming hole from noon until 4:00 p.m.. When the air temperature is near 100 degrees in the Salt Lake Valley the air temperature at the trailhead will be around 80 degrees. The water is brisk but not uncomfortably cold. On a hot day it's easy to swim for 30 minutes or more and not get cold. Trailhead Information: From Kamas, Utah follow Highway 150 (Mirror Lake Highway) east for 22 miles to the signed Murdock Basin turn-off located at mile marker 22.5 on the east side of the highway. From Evanston, Wyoming follow Highway 150 (Mirror Lake Highway) south for 55 miles to the signed Murdock Basin turn-off located at mile marker 22.5 on the east side of the highway. From the Murdock Basin Turn-off (N40° 37' 34\", W110° 57' 37\") you will be following the \"Duchesne River\" signs all the way to the trailhead. Turn east on the Murdock Basin Road http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/cataractgorge.htm 1/25/2018 Cataract Gorge - Uinta Mountains Page 2 of 2 and follow it for 1.3 miles to a signed junction (N40° 38' 08\", W110° 56' 30\"). Take the east (right) fork and follow the road for 1.1 miles to a signed junction (N40° 38' 01\", W110° 55' 33\"). Take the south (right) fork and follow the road for 3.1 miles to the Cataract Gorge Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify because the road ends at a large fenced parking area at the south end of the small lake. Those with four wheel drive should never have a problem reaching the trailhead in good weather conditions. A high clearance vehicle should be able to reach the trailhead in good weather. The road is rough in places but nothing I would consider hardcore four wheel drive. Camping is plentiful near the trailhead. Route Information: From the Cataract Gorge Trailhead (N40° 37' 20\", W110° 53' 25\") hike south following the river. Careful route finding will eliminate the need to scramble over the boulders. 250-yards downstream from the trailhead you will find a magnificent swimming hole (N40° 37' 12\", W110° 53' 23\"). Just below the swimming hole is an old zip-line crossing the river. Jump into the pool of clear water or explorer downstream, its your choice. From the Cataract Gorge Trailhead look west and you will spy Little Deer Creek Waterfall (N40° 37' 19\", W110° 53' 30\"), 100-yards away. Its easy to walk or drive to the base of the waterfall.

I have really never seen anything like this before. A small section of the forest has been decorated with fairy's and other entertaining figures. Children of all ages will enjoy an enchanted trip through the forest. General Information: Fairy Forest is an adventure the entire family can enjoy. A typical visit requires a short stroll through the forest. Your visit will require approximately one hour if you visit the entire forest and look at all the fairy's. The route contains no real obstacles. The route is suitable for anyone that can walk or be carried. During certain times of the year mosquito's can be a problem in the Uinta's. A mosquito repellent that contains DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is most effective. Navigation for this route is easy. A GPS is not required but I have included the waypoints for the gadget junkies. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Soapstone Basin\" shows the area. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Use Fee: Visitors who use recreational facilities along State Road 150 (Mirror Lake Highway) are required to pay a use fee. Visitors who do not use recreation facilities, are not subject to fees. Camping Information: Shady Dell operates on a first come, first served system. There are no reservations available for this campground. The campground contains 20 campsites on the Provo River spread among the pine trees. Maximum RV length is 25-feet. The campground is closed in winter. Facilities are slightly modified to accommodate campers with disabilities. Reservations for other campgrounds in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest can be made on-line at ReserveUSA. Trailhead Information: From Kamas, Utah follow Highway 150 (Mirror Lake Highway) east for 16 miles to the signed Shady Dell Campground entrance located at mile marker 16.8 on the east side of the highway. From Evanston, Wyoming follow Highway 150 (Mirror Lake Highway) south for 61 miles to the signed Shady Dell Campground entrance located at mile marker 16.8 on the east side of the highway. From the Shady Dell Campground Entrance (N40° 35' 23\", W111° 00' 58\") follow the road into the campground for 0.1 miles to an unsigned trail on the east (right) side of the road. This is the trailhead. The trail is easy to identify as it is located after campsite #7 and before campsite #8. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/fairy.htm 1/25/2018 Fairy Forest - Uinta Mountains Page 2 of 2 There is no parking right at the trailhead. The easiest place to park is a small pullout, suitable for one vehicle, across from campsite #11 on the north (left) side of the road. You can also park out on the highway before pulling into the Shady Dell Campground. Route Information: From the Fairy Forest Trailhead (N40° 35' 27\", W111° 00' 48\") follow the trail south for 100-yards to the Fairy Forest (N40° 35' 24\", W111° 00' 46\").

You will know you have arrived at the Fairy Forest when you see hundreds of painted rocks and fairy's hanging in the trees. The forest is filled with rock lined trails and other entertaining items.

The hike to the summit can be completed in one extremely long day but 2 or 3 days is the more popular method. The route is 15 miles each way using the most direct route and will require somewhere between 14 to 20 hours total hiking time. The route can easily be lengthen to visit more remote areas and secluded lakes. The Henrys Fork Trailhead is open year round and the peak is often climbed year round by the extremely adventurous. This hike can be dangerous during spring and early summer (before July 15th) because portions of the trail will still be snow packed and extremely slippery. Snow remains up high in the Uinta's well into summer so plan accordingly. You also might consider trying to avoid the July and August rush on the mountain. The route contains no real obstacles. Hikers in good physical condition and using commonsense should have little problem with this route. The Kings Peak hike is rated 2 V using the Yosemite Decimal System. Afternoon thunderstorms are very common in the high Uinta Mountains so go prepared with rain gear. Because of the lightening that often attacks this summit it is highly advised that you avoid this hike during stormy weather. Mosquito's are common in the Uinta's. A mosquito repellent that contains DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is most effective. Navigation for this route is easy. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Gilbert Peak NE\", \"Bridger Lake\", \"Kings Peak\" and \"Mount Powell\" are helpful. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Fishing: Alligator, Bear Lake, Sawmill Lake, Grass Lake, Henrys Fork Lake and Dollar Lake are all stocked with fish. Fish found in the Uinta's include arctic grayling, brook trout, brown trout, cutthroat trout, golden trout and rainbow trout. A Utah State Fishing License is required to fish in the Uinta's. Clarence King: Kings Peak is named after Clarence King who explored and surveyed a 100 mile wide swath along the 40th parallel from the 120th meridian to the 105th. This was the proposed route http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/kings.htm 1/25/2018 Kings Peak - Uinta Mtns Page 2 of 3 of the transcontinental railroad. The U.S. Army sponsored the expedition, although the only military connection was the use of military posts, supplies and escorts. King was a Yale-trained scientist. King began the survey in 1867 when he was 25 years old. The survey lasted until 1873. During the survey King was struck by lightning and survived. The King survey brought western exploration into the realm of academic science. In 1879, King was named the first director of the U.S. Geological Survey. Trailhead Information: From Evanston, Wyoming follow I-80 east for 35 miles and take Exit 39 south onto Highway 414. Follow Highway 414 south for 6 miles to the town of Mountain View. In Mountain View you must turn west on Highway 410 towards the town of Robertson. 6.7 miles after leaving Mountain View, and before you reach Robertson, you will encounter a junction where Highway 410 makes a sharp turn to the west and a gravel road continues south (straight ahead). Continue south on the gravel road. From Highway 410 you must follow the gravel road for 12.2 miles to a major junction in the road. The road south leads to China Meadows, take the road heading east (left), which is Forest Service Road 077, and follow it for 10.6 miles to the Henrys Fork Campground. Along the way there will be signs pointing the way to the Henrys Fork Campground and Trailhead that will help you out. The Henrys Fork Campground and Trailhead offers restrooms, horse corals and a large parking area to accommodate hikers. It might be wise to note that about half of the traffic at this trailhead is horses. Route Information: From the Henrys Fork Trailhead (N40° 54' 32\", W110° 19' 54\") follow the Henrys Fork Trail southwest as it parallels the stream. After 2 1/2 miles you will cross a boardwalk and reach the unsigned Alligator Lake Junction (N40° 53' 14\", W110° 21' 35\"). The 1/3 mile long spur trail heading west (right) leads to Alligator Lake (N40° 53' 10\", W110° 21' 57\"). Continue following the main trail southwest as it parallels the stream for an additional 3 miles to a major junction known as Elkhorn Crossing (N40° 51' 10\", W110° 23' 02\"). Elkhorn Crossing is where the North Slope Trail crosses the Henrys Fork Trail. The trail to the east (left) leads to Dead Horse Park, the trail to the west (right) leads to the West Side Loop. Continue south (straight ahead) on the Henrys Fork Trail for 1 3/4 miles, across a meadow, to the middle of a stand of spruce trees (N40° 49' 42\", W110° 22' 49\"). At this point, Dollar Lake (N40° 49' 37\", W110° 22' 39\") is located 200 yards east of the trail. If you exit the stand of spruce trees and enter a second meadow you have gone to far. There is no trail leading to Dollar Lake and the lake is not visible from the trail. This lake is remarkably beautiful but overused. This is often where hikers climbing Kings Peak place their base camp. From the stand of spruce trees near Dollar Lake you must continue south on the Henrys Fork Trail for 1 mile to the West Side Loop Junction (N40° 48' 56\", W110° 22' 34\"). The trail heading west (right) is the West Side Loop Trail. Continue south (straight ahead) at this junction and hike for 2 miles as the trail switchbacks up to Gunsight Pass (N40° 47' 49\", W110° 21' 35\"). From Gunsight Pass you will be tempted to scramble the ridge west or short cut across the talus slope. This is a mistake as both options require a lot of extra effort. The easiest route is to stay on the route described. From Gunsight Pass follow the trail southeast as it descends into Painter Basin. 1/2 mile below Gunsight Pass you encounter the Short Cut (N40° 47' 31\", W110° 21' 10\"). The Short Cut is a faint hiker made trail that veers south (right) from the main trail and follows the base of the cliffs. The main trail continues southeast for an additional mile to the Highline Trail Junction (N40° 46' 53\", W110° 20' 28\"). At the Highline Trail Junction turn west (right) and begin climbing towards Anderson Pass. It is 2 1/2 miles from the Junction to Anderson Pass (N40° 47' 07\", W110° 22' 38\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/kings.htm 1/25/2018 Kings Peak - Uinta Mtns Page 3 of 3 From Anderson Pass you must leave the trail and follow the obvious ridge south for 3/4 miles to the summit of Kings Peak (N40° 46' 35\", W110° 22' 22\"). The summit ridge has no trail and the route is a rocky boulder hop. The summit ridge is time consuming but not difficult. Short Cut: For those wishing to use the Short Cut it should be noted that the hiker made trail disappears shortly after leaving the main trail. The route eliminates roughly 1 mile from the trail route. After leaving the main trail the idea is to continue south along the base of the cliffs. Hike along in the meadow below the talus slope. You will eventually reach a point where you can climb up and intersect the Highline Trail (N40° 46' 44\", W110° 21' 24\"). West Side Loop: For those desiring a little more solitude you can complete the West Side Loop. The West Side Loop is 4 3/4 miles long from Elkhorn Crossing to the junction with the Henrys Fork Trail. This is 2 miles longer than the Direct Route that passes near Dollar Lake. From Elkhorn Crossing turn west (right) on the North Slope Trail. Follow the North Slope Trail west for 1 mile to a junction (N40° 50' 59\", W110° 24' 07\") with the West Loop Trail. At the junction turn south (left) and follow the trail for 3 3/4 miles until it interests the Henrys Fork Trail. The West Side Loop can be completed in either direction and provides access to Bear Lake, Sawmill Lake, Grass Lake and Henrys Fork Lake.

Trailhead Information: From Kamas, Utah follow Highway 150 east for 32 miles to the signed Pass Lake Trailhead located at mile marker 32.1. From Evanston, Wyoming follow Highway 150 south for 46 miles to the signed Pass Lake Trailhead located at mile marker 32.1. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/lofty.htm 1/25/2018 Lofty Lake Loop - Uinta Mtns Page 2 of 2 The large parking lot at Pass Lake is located at the end of a short spur road on the north side of Highway 150. The parking lot is dirt and contains an information kiosk and a pit toilet. Improved campgrounds are located nearby at Butterfly Lake, Moosehorn Lake and Mirror Lake. Any vehicle can access this trailhead. Route Information: A trail leads out of both the north and south end of the Pass Lake Trailhead (N40° 42' 51\", W110° 53' 34\"). Both trails are signed Lofty Lake. You want to take the trail that leads out of the south end of the parking area and is signed Weber River/Cuberant Lake/Lofty Lake. This route description is for a clockwise circuit of the loop. From the trailhead follow the Cuberant Lake Trail southwest for 300 yards to a junction (N40° 42' 47\", W110° 53' 47\") signed Highway 150. Take the west (right) trail and continue hiking for 250 yards to a signed junction (N40° 42' 47\", W110° 53' 58\"). Again, take the west (right) trail signed Cuberant Lake/Lofty Lake. From this junction you will hike 1 mile, past Reids Meadow and past two small ponds to the Cuberant Lake Junction (N40° 43' 19\", W110° 54' 18\"). The Cuberant lake Junction is not signed and is difficult to identify if you are not paying attention. The Cuberant Trail heads west and is located immediately after you pass the two ponds. Locating this junction is not important unless you intend to visit Cuberant Lake. From the Cuberant Lake Junction the Lofty Lake Trail heads north and climbs steeply to Kamas Lake (N40° 43' 38\", W110° 54' 09\"). From Kamas Lake the easy to follow trail heads north to a mountain pass. From the pass you can look down on Cutthroat Lake. From the mountain pass the trail swings east and 1 mile after leaving Kamas Lake you will arrive at Lofty Lake (N40° 43' 46\", W110° 53' 39\"). From Lofty Lake the trail continues east and climbs through a second pass that offers amazing views of the surrounding area. This is the high point of the route at an elevation of 10,900'. From the pass the trail descends steeply for 3/4 mile to the signed Scout Lake Junction (N40° 43' 18\", W110° 53' 15\"). The trail to the east (left) leads to the Boy Scout Camp. Follow the trail signed 'Trail' to the south (right). 100 yards after leaving Scout Lake Junction the trail crosses a road used by the scouts. DO NOT follow the road. The trail crosses the road and continues south for 3/4 mile and pass Picturesque Lake before arriving back at the Lake Pass Trailhead. Cuberant Lake: The hike to Cuberant Lake might best be considered a route and not a trail. Although a trail does exist it is often hard to follow and disappears in sections. The 1 1/2 mile trail to Cuberant lake begins at the Cuberant Lake Junction (N40° 43' 19\", W110° 54' 18\"). The trail heads northwest around Mount Marsell. The route than climbs over a minor ridge and heads north passing an unnamed lake before reaching Cuberant Lake (N40° 44' 14\", W110° 54' 48\"). This lake and several of the nearby unnamed lakes often provides seclusion.

From Evanston, Wyoming follow Highway 150 south for 52 miles to the signed Trial Lake turn-off located at mile marker 25.5. You will be following the signs west pointing the way to the Crystal Lake Trailhead. From Highway 150 follow the Trial Lake spur road west for 0.1 miles to a fork. The north (right) fork leads to the Trial Lake Campgrounds, take the south (left) fork and drive 0.6 miles to a junction in the road. Turn west (right) at the junction and follow the paved road 0.5 miles to the Crystal Lake Trailhead. The trailhead is identified with the Washington Lake Campground on the south (left) and the hiker parking lot straight (west) ahead. The hiker parking lot at the Crystal Lake Trailhead is dirt and contains an information kiosk and a pit toilet. This is a large parking lot but it fills up early on summer weekends. Improved campgrounds are located at both Trial Lake and Washington Lake. Any vehicle can access this trailhead. This is also the trailhead for the Wall Lake Loop hike. Route Information: Several different trails begin from the Crystal Lake Trailhead (N40° 40' 54\", W110° 57' 48\"). Make certain you are on the correct trail and that the route description matches what you are seeing during the first 10 minutes of the hike. The signed trail to Long Lake begins from the west end of the parking area next to the toilet and information kiosk. After leaving the trailhead the well-maintained trail leads west and in 1/4 miles reaches a signed spur trail (N40° 40' 58\", W110° 57' 57\"), leading to Cliff Lake. At this point you should have a nice view of Crystal Lake to your south. At this junction do not follow the spur trail to Cliff Lake but continue to hike west (straight ahead) towards Watson Pass. The trail gently switchbacks up and over Watson Pass and descends the backside of the pass. 1 1/2 miles from the trailhead you will reach the signed Long Lake/Weir Lake Junction (N40° 41' 00\", W110° 59' 10\"). The trail to the south (left) leads to Weir Lake and is our return route. For now continue hiking west (straight ahead) towards Long Lake. The lake will become visible within a short distance. Once you reach Long Lake you must hike to the west end of the lake and cross the dam. Immediately after crossing the dam you will encounter a signed junction (N40° 40' 51\", W110° 59' 50\"). The trail to the northeast (right) leads to campsites. Follow the trail to the west (left) that is signed Island Lake. After departing Long Lake enjoy the 3/4 mile stroll to the Duck Lake Junction (N40° 40' 47\", W111° 00' 40\"). At the junction take the signed Island Lake trail heading northwest (right). From the junction to Island Lake is less than 1/2 mile. Island Lake (N40° 40' 56\", W111° 00' 55\") is worth visiting since it is one of the more exquisite Uinta lakes with 11,342' Mount Long rising behind it. After your visit to Island lake you must retrace your path back to the Duck Lake Junction.

Route Information: At the Bald Mountain Trailhead (N40° 41' 22\", W110° 54' 15\") locate the trail signed Notch Lake, the other trail leads to the summit of Bald Mountain. The Notch Mountain trail heads west along the base of Bald Mountain and than swings northwest as it passes Clegg Lake, Dean Lake, Notch Lakes and Bench Lake. Dean Lake is easy to miss if you are not paying attention as it is hidden from view by trees. 4 1/4 miles after leaving the Bald Mountain Trailhead you will encounter a junction (N40° 43' 47\", W110° 56' 34\"). The junction is not signed. The trail to the north (right) drops steeply into the Weber River Drainage. Take the trail to the south (left) as it begins to climb towards Notch Mountain. 1/3 mile after leaving the junction you will encounter a spur trail (N40° 43' 36\", W110° 56' 50\") heading west that is not signed. The spur trail leads to Meadow Lake (N40° 43' 53\", W110° 57' 08\"), which is an easy 1/2 mile hike west. The main trail continues heading south from the spur trail and climbs 1 3/4 miles to \"The Notch\" (N40° 42' 29\", W110° 57' 35\"). Along the way you will pass by Ibantik Lake and Lovenia Lake. From The Notch follow the trail south as it descends. 1/3 mile after leaving The Notch those paying attention will locate a difficult to identify junction (N40° 42' 17\", W110° 57' 27\") with a hiker made spur heading west. The spur trail is not difficult to follow and leads 300 yards west to Twin Lakes (N40° 42' 16\", W110° 57' 40\"). If you miss the difficult to identify spur trail it will not effect your navigation. The main trail continues to gradually descent for 1 1/4 mile to Wall Lake (N40° 41' 40\", W110° 57' 36\"). Along the way you will pass by the very picturesque Hope Lake.

The trail heading west and crossing the bridge leads to the Crystal Lake Trailhead. Do not cross the bridge but instead follow the signed trail south leading to Trial Lake (N40° 40' 47\", W110° 57' 29\"). It is 1 mile from Wall Lake to Trial Lake and this section of trail is popular with families. Climbing Notch Mountain: The summit of 11,263' East Notch Mountain and the summit of 11,258' West Notch Mountain can be obtained by the hardcore. The easiest approach to either summit is to begin at The Notch and scramble up the ridge to the summit. There is no trail and route finding is required. Reaching either summit and returning will add an additional 1 or 2 hours to your trip. The view from the top of either peak is awe-inspiring. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/notch.htm 1/25/2018 Notch Mountain Trail - Uinta Mtns Page 3 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [

Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Shadow Lake Uinta Mountains Hiking & Backpacking The Shadow Lake hike provides access to half a dozen scenic lakes and sequestered fishing holes. The entire route is dominated by the shadow of 10,985' Haystack Mountain. This is an ideal trail for the beginning backpacker or day hiker. Several route options are presented that allow you to tailor your adventure to suit your needs, time and skill level. The hike from the trailhead to Shadow Lake is very child friendly, allowing kids a chance to explore the lakes and mountains without any substantial elevation gain. General Information: The Shadow Lake hike is an adventure the entire family can enjoy with options for the experienced hiker. The route visits a large variety of lakes, meadows and streams. The Shadow Lake area offers a great introduction to overnight backpacking and with adult supervision is a very child friendly region. Haystack Lake contains a large number of nice overnight campsites. The basic hike can be completed in 2 to 3 hours. Exploring all the routes to the various lakes will require an additional 1 to 2 hours. A vehicle shuttle is not required for this route. All hikers in your party should carry a minimum of one liter of water. Water is plentiful in this area, but all water taken from lakes and streams should be filtered before drinking. The route contains no real obstacles. Experienced and intermediate hikers will have no problems with this route. Novice hikers will need to pay attention to their map and route description. The Shadow Lake hike is rated 1 II using the Yosemite Decimal System. Afternoon thunderstorms are very common in the high Uinta Mountains so go prepared with rain gear. Because of the high precipitation mosquito's are common in the Uinta's. A mosquito repellent that contains DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is most effective. Navigation for this route is easy. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Mirror Lake\" is helpful. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. It should be noted that due to new trail construction and trail realignment the USGS maps are not accurate in relation to trail location. The trails are correctly located on the map provided. Use Fee: Visitors who use recreational facilities along State Road 150 (Mirror Lake Highway) are required to pay a use fee. Visitors who do not use recreation facilities, are not subject to fees. Fishing: Washington Lake, Tail Lake, Shadow Lakes, Rock Lake, Azure Lake and Haystack Lake are all stocked with fish. Fish found in the Uinta's include arctic grayling, brook trout, brown trout, cutthroat trout, golden trout and rainbow trout. A Utah State Fishing License is required to fish in the Uinta's. Trailhead Information: From Kamas, Utah follow Highway 150 east for 25 miles to the signed Trial Lake turn-off located at mile marker 25.5. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/shadow.htm 1/25/2018 Shadow Lake Loop - Uinta Mtns Page 2 of 3 From Evanston, Wyoming follow Highway 150 south for 52 miles to the signed Trial Lake turn-off located at mile marker 25.5. There are three trailhead options for this route, you can mix and match to suit your needs. The Washington Group Area Trailhead is my recommendation as the best place to start. Improved campgrounds are located at both Trial Lake and Washington Lake. Any vehicle can access these trailheads. Washington Group Area Trailhead: From Highway 150 follow the Trial Lake spur road west for 0.1 miles to a fork. The north (right) fork leads to the Trial Lake Campground, take the south (left) fork and drive 0.6 miles to a junction in the road. The road to the west (right) leads to the Washington Campground and Crystal Lake Trailhead. Follow the main road, known as the Haystack Road, south (straight ahead) for an additional 0.1 miles to a junction signed Washington Group Area. Turn west (right) at the junction and follow the paved road into the Washington Group Area. You will find a parking lot signed \"Overflow Parking\" on the south (left) side of the road 0.1 miles into the group area. This is the trailhead (N40° 40' 24\", W110° 57' 43\"). Washington Campground Trailhead: From Highway 150 follow the Trial Lake spur road west for 0.1 miles to a fork. The north (right) fork leads to the Trial Lake Campground, take the south (left) fork and drive 0.6 miles to a junction in the road. Turn west (right) at the junction and follow the paved road 0.4 miles to the signed Washington Lake Campground (N40° 40' 46\", W110° 57' 42\"). You must pay a fee for a campsite to park inside the campground. Haystack Trailhead: From Highway 150 follow the Trial Lake spur road west for 0.1 miles to a fork. The north (right) fork leads to the Trial Lake Campground, take the south (left) fork and drive 0.6 miles to a junction in the road. The road to the west (right) leads to the Washington Campground and Crystal Lake Trailhead. Follow the main road south (straight ahead) for an additional 0.1 miles to a junction signed Washington Group Area. Do not turn into the group area. The main road, known as the Haystack Road, becomes gravel at this point. Continue south on the Haystack Road for an additional 1.5 miles to the crest of a hill. This is the Haystack Trailhead (N40° 39' 16\", W110° 57' 41\"). Available parking on both sides of the road identifies the trailhead. There is no sign but a large post is on the west side of the road where the trail begins. 100 feet up the trail is a metal gate to stop ATV travel. Route Information: This route description will be described beginning at the recommended Washington Group Area Trailhead. Optional trailheads will be mentioned where appropriate in the route description. If available, a shuttle vehicle or bicycle left at the Haystack Trailhead will shorten the return hike. A shuttle is a pleasant option but is not really required since the route is not that long to begin with. From the Washington Group Area Trailhead (N40° 40' 24\", W110° 57' 43\") hike west to the top of the campground. Climb the short wooden stairs and follow the well-maintained trail west 1/4 miles to a trail junction (N40° 40' 33\", W110° 57' 51\") on the south end of the Washington Lake Dam. The trail north (right) leads across the top of the dam to the Washington Lake Campground 1/4 mile away. Take the trail south (left) as it follows along the shore of Washington Lake. The trail from the Washington Lake Dam to Haystack Lake is 2 miles long and passes by Tail Lake, which is actually part of Washington Lake when it is completely full before reaching the radiant Shadow Lake. From Shadow Lake the trail turns southeast and descends slightly before reaching the Haystack Junction (N40° 39' 21\", W110° 58' 03\") located to the east of Haystack Lake. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/shadow.htm 1/25/2018 Shadow Lake Loop - Uinta Mtns Page 3 of 3 From Haystack Junction the trail to the east (left) descends 1/3 mile to the Haystack Trailhead. The trail to the west (right) leads 150 yards to Haystack Lake (N40° 39' 20\", W110° 58' 11\"). Route Options: It is easy to visit Rock Lake and Azure Lake and make a loop hike out of the route. This option is suggested for experienced hikers who can navigate. There is no trail to either Rock Lake or Azure Lake and some route finding and scrambling is required. The best route is after reaching Shadow Lake head southwest along the base of Haystack mountain until you reach Rock Lake (N40° 39' 33\", W110° 58' 48\"). Along the way you will have to scramble across a 1/4 mile wide boulder field. After reaching Rock Lake head 100 yards south to find Azure Lake (N40° 39' 26\", W110° 58' 40\"). From Azure Lake head east, back across the boulder field, and descend to Haystack Lake.

The entire route is dominated by the shadow of 11, 527' Mount Watson. This is an ideal trail for the beginning backpacker or day hiker. Fishermen will also profit from the information presented. Several route options are provided that allow you to tailor your adventure to suit your needs, time and skill level. The hike from the trailhead to Wall Lake is very child friendly, allowing kids a chance to explore the lakes and mountains without any substantial elevation gain. General Information: The Wall Lake Loop hike is an adventure the entire family can enjoy. The route visits a large variety of lakes, meadows and streams. The Wall Lake area offers a great introduction to overnight backpacking and with adult supervision is a very child friendly region. The basic loop hike can be completed in 3 to 4 hours. Exploring all the spur trails to the various lakes will require an additional 1 to 2 hours. A vehicle shuttle is not required for this loop route. All hikers in your party should carry a minimum of one liter of water. Water is plentiful in this area, but all water taken from lakes and streams should be filtered before drinking. The route contains no real obstacles. Experienced and intermediate hikers will have no problems with this route. Novice hikers will need to pay attention to their map and route description. The Wall Lake Loop hike is rated 1 III using the Yosemite Decimal System. Afternoon thunderstorms are very common in the high Uinta Mountains so go prepared with rain gear. Because of the high precipitation mosquito's are common in the Uinta's. A mosquito repellent that contains DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is most effective. Navigation for this route is easy. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Mirror Lake\" is helpful. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Always check your GPS to ensure that WGS84 is the datum before entering a waypoint into your unit. It should be noted that due to new trail construction and trail realignment the USGS maps are not accurate in relation to trail location. The trails are correctly located on the map provided on this page. Use Fee: Visitors who use recreational facilities along State Road 150 (Mirror Lake Highway) are required to pay a use fee. Visitors who do not use recreation facilities, are not subject to fees. Fishing: Wall Lake, Lovenia Lake, Twin Lakes, John Lake, Clyde Lake, Booker Lake, Hidden Lake, Watson Lake and Cliff Lake are all stocked with fish. Fish found in the Uinta's include arctic grayling, brook trout, brown trout, cutthroat trout, golden trout and rainbow trout. A Utah State Fishing License is required to fish in the Uinta's. Trailhead Information: From Kamas, Utah follow Highway 150 east for 25 miles to the signed Trial Lake turn-off located at mile marker 25.5. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/wall.htm 1/25/2018 Wall Lake Loop - Uinta Mtns Page 2 of 3 From Evanston, Wyoming follow Highway 150 south for 52 miles to the signed Trial Lake turn-off located at mile marker 25.5. You will be following the signs west pointing the way to the Crystal Lake Trailhead. From Highway 150 follow the Trial Lake spur road west for 0.1 miles to a fork. The north (right) fork leads to the Trial Lake Campgrounds, take the south (left) fork and drive 0.6 miles to a junction in the road. Turn west (right) at the junction and follow the paved road 0.5 miles to the Crystal Lake Trailhead. The trailhead is identified with the Washington Lake Campground on the south (left) and the hiker parking lot straight (west) ahead. The hiker parking lot at the Crystal Lake Trailhead is dirt and contains an information kiosk and a pit toilet. This is a large parking lot but it fills up early on summer weekends. Improved campgrounds are located at both Trial Lake and Washington Lake. Any vehicle can access this trailhead. This is also the trailhead for the Long Lake Loop hike. Route Information: Several different trails begin from the Crystal Lake Trailhead (N40° 40' 54\", W110° 57' 48\"). Make certain you are on the correct trail and that the route description matches what you are seeing during the first 10 minutes of the hike. The signed trail to Wall Lake begins from the west end of the parking area near a wooden ramp and heads north. After leaving the trailhead the well-maintained trail will immediately pass between the two Lilly Lakes. Follow the trail to Wall Lake, which is 1 mile long and has an elevation gain of only 100 feet. When you reach Wall Lake cross east over the top of the dam and use the bridge over the river. On the east side of the bridge you will encounter a signed junction (N40° 41' 40\", W110° 57' 36\"). The trail to the south (right) leads to the optional Trial Lake Trailhead. Continue following the trail east (straight) towards Notch Mountain. The next 1 1/4 miles of trail is very enticing as it passes around Hope Lake, switchbacks up a large rock ledge, and passes a second unnamed lake. The trail crosses a meadow and climbs a second small rock ledge. On top of this second rock ledge is a junction (N40° 42' 17\", W110° 57' 27\") and the most difficult route finding required. The junction is not signed, but usually contains a cairn (stack of rocks) or painted rocks. The junction is located in the middle of some smooth, flat rock so the trail is not easily identified. At the junction, the trail to the north (straight) climbs through the pass of Notch Mountain to Lovenia Lake (N40° 42' 39\", W110° 57' 32\"). Visiting Lovenia Lake will add 1 mile and 30 minutes to your overall route. At the junction the path to the west (left) leads to Twin Lakes and is the trail you need to take. The trail to Twin Lakes is not as well defined as the Notch Mountain trail and is not maintained. The trail is not difficult to follow and leads 300 yards west to Twin Lakes (N40° 42' 16\", W110° 57' 40\"). There is a small 10-foot rock ledge separating the two lakes. Climb on top of the rock ledge and circle around the north side of the upper lake. From the west end of Twin Lakes it is 1/4 miles to Clyde Lake. The trail through this section is very faint and appears and disappears, but if you head straight towards the summit of Mount Watson you will walk right into Clyde Lake (N40° 42' 12\", W110° 58' 03\"). From the east end of Clyde Lake you can hike 400 yards directly north and visit John Lake (N40° 42' 18\", W110° 58' 06\"). From the east end of Clyde Lake follow the trail as it circles around the north side of Clyde Lake. 1/4 mile along this trail you will notice an unsigned junction with a trail that leads northwest up through a saddle. This hiker made trail leads towards Booker Lake, Three Divide Lakes and on to Hidden Lake (N40° 42' 34\", W110° 58' 52\"). The trail disappears shortly after leaving Clyde Lake but the route to Hidden Lake is 3/4 miles long and will add approximately 45 minutes to your route. Route finding and navigation is required for this short excursion. The trail back to Crystal Lake Trailhead leaves Clyde Lake at it's southern tip and climbs a short distance offering incredible views of the basin. The trail back is 1 3/4 miles long as it descends past Watson Lake, Linear Lake, Petit Lake and Cliff Lake. Eventually you will reach a http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/wall.htm 1/25/2018 Wall Lake Loop - Uinta Mtns Page 3 of 3 signed tee in the trail (N40° 40' 57\", W110° 57' 57\"). The trail to the west (right) leads to Long Lake. The trail to the east (left) leads back to the Crystal Lake Trailhead 400 yards away. Optional Trailhead Information: Using the Trial Lake Trailhead (N40° 40' 47\", W110° 57' 29\") is an option for those camping at Trail Lake or anyone crowded out of the Crystal Lake Trailhead. The Trial Lake/Wall Lake Trail begins on the west end of the Trial Lake Dam. From the west end of the dam hike around behind (to the west) of two cabins and easily locate the trail as it traverses along the west shore of Trial Lake and than follows the stream to Wall Lake (N40° 41' 40\", W110° 57' 36\"). This trail is 1 mile long and because of additional elevation gain is only slightly more difficult than the standard route from the Crystal Lake Trailhead. This trail is more picturesque than the standard route as is follows a lovely stream and crosses a ravishing meadow along the way. Climbing Mount Watson: The summit of 11,527' Mount Watson can be obtained by the hardcore. The easiest approach is to begin at Three Divide Lakes and scramble up the North Ridge to the summit (N40° 41' 54\", W110° 58' 47\"). There is no trail and route finding and scrambling is required. Reaching the summit and returning will add an additional 2 or 3 hours to your trip, but the view from the top is unsurpassed.

Trailhead Information: From Main Street and Center Street in Alpine, Utah travel north on Main Street for 0.7 miles to a fork. Take the left (west) fork signed Fort Canyon Road. Follow Fort Canyon Road for 1.0 mile to a metal gate, located on the north (left) side of the road that is blocking a gravel road heading north. This is the Alpine Sliding Rock Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify as it is located at a sharp right (south) turn in the road, combined with the metal gate blocking access to the gravel road. Find a place to park where you are not blocking traffic. This is a residential area so extreme care should be used while at the trailhead to avoid problems and potential conflicts that might result in future access issues. The Alpine Sliding Rock Trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/alpinerock.htm 1/25/2018 Alpine Sliding Rock - Hiking & Swimming Page 2 of 3 Route Information: From the Alpine Sliding Rock Trailhead (N40° 28' 41\", W111° 46' 53\"), pass through the metal gate and follow the gravel road northeast for 200-yards to where it intersects a paved road.

News: KSL - Popular Utah County water recreation spot closes to make way for homes December 12, 2014 ALPINE — A water recreation hot spot in Utah County is closed and public access is not likely to return, with a residential development soon to take over the land. The slippery, shallow falls known as “Sliding Rock” in Alpine has drawn hundreds of visitors on summer weekends in recent years, but City Councilwoman Kimberly Bryant said the site has always stood on private property. “It’s not Alpine City’s,” Bryant said. “It’s never been ours, and it never will be. It’s not for sale.” Bryant said the area has been slated for development since at least 1984. The city had an opportunity to annex the land once within the past decade, but Bryant said residents voted the acquisition down. The current developer, according to Bryant, plans to bring high-end homes to “Three Falls Estates” along with 450 acres of public open space and over 10 miles of public trails, but the public access to Sliding Rock has closed. Large No Trespassing signs now sit at the entrance to the property. The ballooning popularity of the site had presented challenges to surrounding neighbors. “They were blocking the driveways — it was very, very narrow with little private driveways,” Bryant said. “A lot of families were really respectful and great and nice about it, but unfortunately with anything like that you will have people who are disrespectful.” Ruth Ann Haws has taken her children every year to Sliding Rock, and said she is disappointed the area has closed. “I think all of them except our 2-year-old have been down it so far and we’d sure like it to be there when he’s a couple years older,” Haws said. “It would sure make a lot of us sad if we don’t get to use it anymore.” Chris Rudolph has walked with his dogs through the area for the past 16 years. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/alpinerock.htm 1/25/2018 Alpine Sliding Rock - Hiking & Swimming Page 3 of 3 “My concern is hiking access, but I’ve been assured there will be a parking lot down here,” Rudolph said. Bryant, who has family pictures at Sliding Rock dating back to the early 1980s, said the change is something everyone feels. “We had just a lot of fun and I understand people being sad about it, because I feel sad about it too,” Bryant said.

The panel consists of several painted figures. The most prominent and well persevered figures are several small animal figures. If you look closely you will notice at one time the rock face contained numerous figures, but most have faded from time and weather over the years. General Information: The Davis Creek Pictographs are a terrific way for the family to spend an afternoon together. The hike is less than 1 mile round trip and will require approximately 30 minutes each way, This adventure is accessible year round, but the footing could be difficult is snowy conditions. Everyone in your group should carry at least one liter of water. A GPS is not really required, but the waypoints are provided for the gizmo junkies in the crowd. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Bountiful Peak\" shows the area described. The USGS map is out of date and the roads and trails in the area are not shown correctly. Navigation for this route is easy if you follow the route description provided. The hike to the Davis Creek Pictographs is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: The Davis Creek Trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. The trailhead is located in Farmington Utah. From the intersection of State Street and Main Street in Farmington follow Main Street east for 0.7 miles to 500 South, Turn east (left) on 500 South and follow the road for 0.8 miles to the Davis Creek Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify as it contains parking for a couple of cars and the beginning of the trail is signed \"Davis Creek Trail\". The trailhead is located 150-yards beyond a small reservoir on the west side of the road The trailhead located at the small reservoir is not the trailhead you want. Route Information: From the Davis Creek Trailhead (N40° 57' 58\", W111° 52' 22\"), Follow the signed trail east as it climbs the mountain. Approximately 1/4 mile beyond the trailhead you will reach a signed junction. The trail to the north (left) leads 100-yards to the Indian Bathtubs (N40° 57' 57\", W111° 52' 02\"). The Indian Bathtubs consist of several waist deep pools that you can cool off it. Continue following the trail east (right) signed Waterfall. 20-yards beyond the first junction you will reach a second junction. The trail to the south (right) leads 1/2 mile to Pretty Valley. Continue following the trail east (left) signed Waterfall. 100-yards beyond the second junction you will reach the top of a small waterfall. From the top of the waterfall there is a very prominent rock outcropping 100-yards east. The Davis Creek Pictographs (N40° 57' 56\", W111° 51' 59\") are located at the base of the rock outcropping under a small overhang. The pictographs are easy to locate if you look for the red paint of the numerous weathered images. Once you locate that section of rock several smaller well preserved images will become clear. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/daviscreek.htm 1/25/2018 Davis Creek Pictographs - Hiking & Rock Art Page 2 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] © Copyright 2000- 2018, Climb-Utah.com http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/daviscreek.htm 1/25/2018 Devils Castle Traverse - Wasatch Mountains Page 1 of 2 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Devils Castle Traverse Little Cottonwood Canyon Wasatch Mountains Mountain Scramble Devils Castle is a rugged mountain above Alta Ski Resort in Albion Basin. The traverse of the mountain is an entertaining scramble that is easily accessible for a half day of fun. Those new to scrambling or rock climbing will find the exposure intimidating. The route described also passes by the very popular and picturesque Secret Lake in Albion Basin and allows easy access to the summit of 11,051' Sugarloaf Peak for peak baggers who still need to add this summit to their list. General Information: The summit of Devils Castle is 10,961. This mountain actually has three peaks, which are nearly identical in height. I believe the middle peak is the highest since it contains the summit register located in a mailbox. This mountaineering scramble will require 4 or 5 hours to complete. The Devils Castle traverse requires a fair amount of scrambling with major exposure. There is nothing difficult about the scrambling but in several places a fall would be fatal. \"Brighton\" is the USGS 7.5 minute topographical map which shows Devils Castle. Navigation for this route is easy. Mountain goat are often visible while hiking Devils Castle if you keep your eyes open and look for them. If you wish to visit the summit of Sugarloaf Peak than add an extra 30 minutes to your hiking time. Since 11,051' Sugarloaf Peak is the 13th highest peak in Salt Lake City this is a good time to tick the summit off your peak baggers list. The short trip to the summit of Sugarloaf offers no difficulties. Excellent camping is available at the Albion Basin Campground which is located at the trailhead. There is a campground host on site. Restrooms and drinking water are provided. Both reserved and first come, first serve sites are available. Reserve America handles on-line site reservations. Trailhead Information: From I-15 in Sandy, Utah take Exit #298 (9000 South) and head east on Highway 209 (9000 South) for 6.9 miles at which point Highway 209 joins Highway 210 (Little Cottonwood Canyon Road) at a Y-Junction. All mileage in this canyon is measured from this Y-Junction. The junction is identified be a huge flashing message board on the south side of the road and a park and ride lot on the north side of the canyon. The park and ride lot has a restroom. From the Y-Junction at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon drive up canyon 11.1 miles to a parking lot on the left side of the road just before the entrance to the Albion Basin Campground. The road up Little Cottonwood Canyon is paved as far as the Alta Ski Resort but the last 2.4 miles of the road is a well maintained gravel road. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/devilscastle.htm 1/25/2018 Devils Castle Traverse - Wasatch Mountains Page 2 of 2 Parking in the upper canyon is limited and the road above Alta Ski Resort is often closed when crowds in the upper canyon become to large. If you want to be assured of a parking place on a weekend it is best to arrive early (before 9:00 a.m.). Route Information: The trail begins next to the entrance of Albion Basin Campground (N40° 34' 40\", W111° 36' 47\"). Your first destination is Secret Lake, the trail is supposed to be signed but last time I was in the area the signs had been torn down. Some folks spell Secret lake as Cecret Lake, but the USGS maps list it as Secret and I will stick with that. From the Albion Basin Campground entrance the trail hikes around the west side of the campground and interests an access road. Follow the access road west. After a short distance the access road will fork with the right fork leading to a cabin and the left fork leading to Secret Lake. Take the left fork and continue to Secret Lake. The road you are following shortly turns into a wide trail as it climbs to Secret Lake. The area is criss-crossed with minor trails, just keep following the most well used trail west and you will reach Secret Lake (N40° 34' 18\", W111° 37' 17\"). Enjoy the view of the North Face of Devils Castle as you hike to the lake. This view is very impressive. From Secret Lake you must climb the hiker made trail, which leads up the steep rock slope to the saddle between Devils Castle and Sugarloaf. The trail is easy to identify looking south from the lake. From the saddle (N40° 33' 55\", W111° 37' 16\") between Devils Castle and Sugarloaf you can climb to the summit of Sugarloaf Peak (N40° 33' 57\", W111° 37' 30\") if you have a little extra time and would like to add the peak to your bag. In the saddle you should also find an interesting rock enclosure that was built by some enterprising hikers. From the saddle follow the ridge east to begin the traverse of Devils Castle. The best route is usually found on the American Fork side of the ridge. If you find your route difficult than look around because an easier way probably exists. You should encounter no major obstacle if you route find carefully. The traverse of Devils Castle involves scrambling over three mountain peaks. The route looks scarier from a distance than it actually is, but if you have any problems reaching the first peak I suggest you turn around because the remainder is more of the same. On the summit of the middle and highest peak (N40° 33' 56\", W111° 36' 48\") you will find a summit register in a mailbox. From the summit of the third peak you will notice an audit (small mine) and it's tailings about 400 yards to the east. This is where the route down begins. Hike down the ridge and over to the audit (N40° 33' 57\", W111° 36' 38\"). From the Audit hike north over the ridge and down to the ski resort service road. Follow the service road down and it will lead you back to the campground and trailhead.

The hike into the Hot Spring is short enough to be enjoyable for most people and long enough to keep out some of the riff-raff. Fifth Water Hot Spring is one of the most picturesque Hot Springs you will ever visit and the water temperature is perfect for a backcountry hot tub. Nothing beats soaking in a crystal clear wilderness Hot Spring while surrounded by freshly fallen snow. The pictures on this web page do not do justice to the beauty of the area. The pools are bright, clear and full of color. General Information: The hike into the Hot Springs is 2 1/4 miles from the Fifth Water Trailhead and will require approximately one hour each way. The Hot Springs can be reached year round and are particularly popular on Saturday. Spring and Fall are the most crowded seasons for visiting the Hot Springs. Bring plenty of water since the hike and soaking in the hot tubs can be very dehydrating. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' map titled \"Rays Valley\" are useful items. Navigation for this route is easy. The trail is well maintained and signed. You might encounter a rattlesnake along the trail during warmer weather, the area is known for them. This is a good reason to leave your dog at home and to keep your children within sight. Go prepared to take a nice soak and don't forget a towel to dry off. The hot springs are popular with families. Skinny-dipping anywhere in Utah County is illegal and Utah County has been cracking down on violators, so don't forget your swimming suit. The temperature of the pools can be regulated amazingly well by adjusting the flow of fresh stream water allowed to enter the rocked off hot tubs. The temperature of most the hot tubs can be adjusted from warm to uncomfortably hot. If you visit the Hot Springs consider taking a small plastic garbage bag and carrying out more trash than you carry in. The Hot Springs are very clean and nice but there is always an inconsiderate person who leaves a mess for others. This is a location, which could remain enchanting for many years with a little help from us all or become trashed in a hurry. Please provide a little extra effort to create an enjoyable place to visit. Winter Information: Winter is my favorite time to soak in the Fifth Water Hot Springs. My family has enjoyed them when the air temperature was a balmy 6° Fahrenheit. The paved road from Highway 6 to the Fifth Water Trailhead is occasionally plowed but often snow packed. Four wheel drives or vehicles with chains should have no problems reaching the trailhead in most conditions. The trail into the Hot Springs has enough traffic that it remains snow packed for most of the winter and can usually be hiked with good winter footwear. After a heavy snowfall, the trail might require snowshoes or cross-country skis for easy access. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/fifth.htm 1/25/2018 Fifth Water Hot Sping - Spanish Fork Canyon - Hiking & Hot Tubbing Page 2 of 2 Trailhead Information: From I-15 in Spanish Fork, Utah, take Exit 261. Follow Highway 6 towards Price for 11.1 miles to mile marker 184.1 and the signed Diamond Fork turn-off. Follow the paved road up Diamond Fork for 10.0 miles to the signed Three Forks Trailhead. The trailhead is large, signed and contains a vault toilet and information kiosk. Route Information: From the Three Forks Trailhead (N40° 05' 05\", W111° 21' 20\") follow the trail through a gate signed \"Please Keep Gate Closed\". 20 yards after passing through the gate you will see a bridge on your right (west), Continue straight and do not cross the bridge, which leads to Cottonwood Canyon. The trail is a beautiful walk in the forest as you follow a roaring river through pines, pinions and junipers. One mile from the trailhead you will encounter a second bridge (N40° 05' 08\", W111° 20' 21\"). The bridge is near the halfway point. Cross the bridge. On the far (south) side of the bridge is a junction. The trail to the left (east) follows the main river up Sixth Water Creek. Continue straight ahead (south) and follow the small stream as it climbs up Fifth Water Canyon. Continue hiking up the trail for 1 1/4 mile until you arrive at the main Hot Springs (N40° 04' 58\", W111° 19' 05\"). The hot springs are easy to identify with an interesting waterfall at the head of the main swimming area. There are two secluded Hot Spring tubs (N40° 04' 56\", W111° 19' 02\") located approximately 200 yards above the waterfall. The tubs are called \"Myers Tubs\" after the builder. These secluded hot tubs are very well constructed and not easily visible from the main trail. There are also two excellent tubs located 50 yards downstream from the main tub and waterfall. Many minor tubs are also easy to locate with a little exploring. Backdoor Trailhead: There is a second entrance to Fifth Water that I refer to as the \"Back Door\". From I-15 in Spanish Fork, Utah, take Exit 261. Follow Highway 6 towards Price for 22.5 miles to mile marker 194.8 and the signed Sheep Creek/Strawberry Reservoir turn-off. From Highway 6 follow the paved Sheep Creek Road north for 14.1 miles to the signed Fifth Water Trailhead, do not turn off of the main road until you arrive at the Backdoor Trailhead. The trailhead is usually signed. If the sign has been ripped down (which seems to happen with regularity) the trailhead is still easy to identify by the large Forest Service log barrier constructed across the trail to keep out ATV's and other problem vehicles. Backdoor Information: From the Backdoor Trailhead (N40° 06' 21\", W111° 17' 28\") just follow the well-defined trail west for 2 1/2 miles. The trail descends the Fifth Water Drainage and will result in an elevation loss of just over 600 feet. The trail is an enjoyable stroll and follows a stream for most the distance as it meanders through pinions, junipers and pines. The main Hot Springs (N40° 04' 58\", W111° 19' 05\") are easy to locate and are situated at the base of a small waterfall. The trail passes next to the waterfall and there is a section of retaining fence along the trail to stop rocks from being kicked down onto anyone soaking in the Hot Spring.

The trail provides an excellent and fun loop hike. The route is very picturesque, visits several high alpine lakes and has several route options available. The route is easy to hike and suitable for beginners. General Information: The Granite Lakes Loop is one of the best hikes in the Wasatch Mountains. The route visits three lakes and spur trails allow you to visit three more if you desire. The basic loop is 3 miles around and will require approximately 2 1/2 to 3 hours. All hikers in your party should carry a minimum of one liter of water. Water is plentiful in this area, but all water taken from lakes and streams should be filtered before drinking. Insect repellent is a good idea as mosquitoes can be bothersome during certain times of the year. A mosquito repellent that contains DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is highly recommended. Navigation for this route is moderate. The area is criss-crossed with trails and ski resort access roads so paying attention to your map and route description is required. The one bonus is mistakes in navigation are easy to overcome and correct. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Brighton\" are helpful. You might also find a map of the Brighton Ski Resort useful. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. It should be noted that the USGS maps are not accurate for trails in this area. Numerous trails including the Granite Lakes Loop are not shown correctly. The trails are correctly located on the map provided. This route is suitable for beginners and rated 1 II using the Yosemite Decimal System. Big Cottonwood Canyon is within Salt Lake City Watershed, therefore special restrictions apply and are strictly enforced. No domestic animals (dogs, cats, horses) are permitted in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Trailhead Information: From anywhere in the Salt lake Valley take I-215 East until you reach the 6200 South Exit (Exit 6). Signs are marked for the ski areas, you will be heading towards Brighton and Solitude Ski Resorts. Drive east on 6200 south and the road will become Wasatch Boulevard. Follow Wasatch Boulevard south to an intersection with Fort Union Boulevard (7200 South). The intersection is located 1.7 miles after exiting I-215. All mileage is taken from the intersection of Wasatch Boulevard and Fort Union Boulevard. This is known locally as the \"Mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon\". There is a large Park and Ride lot with restrooms located near the north east corner of the intersection. From the intersection drive east up Big Cottonwood Canyon. After driving 14.2 miles up canyon the road will fork into a one-way loop. follow the one-way loop right (west) and drive 50 yards to the signed Silver Lake Trailhead on the right (north) side of the road. The trailhead is designated with a large paved parking lot, restroom, information kiosk and visitor center. The Silver Lake Trailhead is the beginning of several popular hikes. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/granite.htm 1/25/2018 Granite Lakes Trail - Big Cottonwood Canyon - Hiking Page 2 of 2 Route Information: From the Silver Lake Trailhead (N40° 36' 13\", W111° 35' 03\") you need to hike to the north side of Silver Lake. You can hike around the lake in either direction, but counter clockwise is the shortest route at 1/3 mile. On the north side of Silver Lake you will encounter a major unsigned junction (N40° 36' 18\", W111° 35' 20\") with a trail leading north. Follow the trail north for 150 yards to a second unsigned junction (N40° 36' 21\", W111° 35' 22\"). The trail straight ahead leads to Lake Solitude. Turn west (left) and follow the old access road as it climb's across the face of the cliffs above Silver Lake. Follow the old access road as it climbs 3/4 mile to the top of the Evergreen Ski Lift (N40° 35' 55\", W111° 35' 44\"). Along this section of trail a bunch of ski trails join and leave the main road. Just keep following the main/biggest trail up ward and you will eventually arrive at the top of the Evergreen Ski Lift and the base of the Twin Lakes Dam. Once you reach Twin Lakes the most difficult part of the loop hike is finished. At this point the Granite Lakes Trail crosses the Lake Solitude Trail. They two trail can be combined for a full day adventure. From the top of the Evergreen Ski Lift you must follow the ski lift access road to the south end of Twin Lakes Dam (N40° 35' 51\", W111° 35' 44\"). Twin Lakes is at it's prettiest in mid summer before the lake is drained for culinary water use. From the south end of Twin Lakes Dam you must cross the access road and locate the unsigned trail leading south across the face of Mount Millicent. The trail from Twin Lakes to Lake Mary is 1 mile in length. This section of trail is relatively easy and extremely beautiful. You will pass beside the lovely Lake Mary and reach a major trail junction at the base of the Lake Mary Dam (N40° 35' 23\", W111° 35' 13\"). The trail leading south (uphill) is an option that requires an extra hour and will pass Lake Martha and take you to Lake Catherine (N40° 34' 54\", W111° 35' 38\"). The trail leading east (downhill) is the main loop. 300 yards after hiking east (downhill) from the Lake Mary Dam you will encounter the Dog Lake Junction (N40° 35' 23\", W111° 35' 03\"). The trail leading south (uphill) is 200 yards in length and leads to Dog Lake. This optional trail will require 15 minutes to explore. To avoid confusion it should be noted that there are two Dog Lakes in Big Cottonwood Canyon. The other Dog Lake is located in Mill D. From the Dog Lake Junction the main trail leads east and than north (downhill) to the Brighton Ski Resort. It can get very confusing in this area with all the criss-crossing ski trails and access roads. Just keep hiking downhill following the best trail. 1 mile after leaving the Dog Lake Junction you will arrive at the main lodge at Brighton Ski Resort (N40° 35' 52\", W111° 35' 02\"). From Brighton Ski Resort you will need to hike 1/2 mile north on the Brighton Loop Road to reach the Silver lake Trailhead. You can hike the one-way road in either direction since it is about equal in length.

Little Cottonwood Canyon Pictographs - Fremont Indian Rock Art Page 1 of 4 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Little Cottonwood Canyon Pictographs Wasatch Mountains Not far up Little Cottonwood Canyon, just off the trail, Fremont Indians lived in a rock-slide cave about 1,000 years ago, where they drew a pictograph with the mineral red oquirrh. Native American rock art is extremely rare in the Salt Lake Valley. Considering the extreme and wet environment of the canyon this is a beautiful and well preserved pictograph. The pictograph consists of a human figure with horns that appears to be holding bow, and off to the side is a quadruped, with what appears to be antlers. General Information: Little Cottonwood Canyon Pictographs consist of two figures located inside a small cave. This adventure will require about 30 minutes to complete using the standard route description. An optional route description is also presented which creates an easy but enjoyable hike, which will require about 2 to 3 hours. A flashlight is highly recommended for locating and viewing the rock art inside the dimly lighted cave. Please do not touch the pictographs and avoid disturbing the cave. The rock art is moderately difficult to locate without a GPS and nearly impossible to locate without a good route description. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Dromedary Peak\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy. You will be following a well defined trail the entire route. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Little Cottonwood Canyon Pictographs are rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/llcpic.htm 1/25/2018 Little Cottonwood Canyon Pictographs - Fremont Indian Rock Art Page 2 of 4 Trailhead Information: From I-15 in Sandy, Utah take Exit #298 (9000 South) and head east on Highway 209 (9000 South) for 6.9 miles at which point Highway 209 joins Highway 210 (Little Cottonwood Canyon Road) at a Y-Junction. All mileage in this canyon is measured from this Y-Junction. The junction is identified be a huge flashing message board on the south side of the road and a park and ride lot on the north side of the canyon. The park and ride lot has a restroom. From the Y-Junction at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon drive up canyon 1.9 miles and park near the Old Power Plant on the right (south) side of the road. (N40° 34' 16\", W111° 44' 33\"). http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/llcpic.htm 1/25/2018 Little Cottonwood Canyon Pictographs - Fremont Indian Rock Art Page 3 of 4 Route Description: Warning, if Little Cottonwood Creek is in high water or spring run-off conditions it can be deadly to cross. If the stream is not safe to cross use the Optional Route Description below. The optional route is a little longer but makes for a much more enjoyable hike. Walk behind the Old Power Plant, cross Little Cottonwood Creek, and join the Little Cottonwood Creek Trail (also called the Little Cottonwood Pipeline Trail and Quarry Trail). Hike east on the Little Cottonwood Creek Trail for 1/4 mile and you will see a cave on the right (south) side of the trail formed by several large boulders. This cave is often called \"Rock Slide Cave\" and contains the pictographs (N40° 34' 14\", W111° 44' 19\"). Rock Slide Cave can easily be seen while hiking Little Cottonwood Creek Trail if you are looking for it. The cave is located about 40-yards off the trail and about 25-feet up the hill. The cave is about 20-feet deep and the pictographs are located at the very back of the cave near ground level. A flashlight is extremely useful in view the rock art. Optional Route Description: On Highway 209 just before the stop sign at the Y-Junction at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon you will see a road on the east (right) side of the highway. Turn east on this road which leads a short distance to the Temple Quarry Trailhead (N40° 34' 18\", W111° 46' 29\"). The Little Cottonwood Canyon Trail is located at the east end of the parking lot and follows Little Cottonwood Creek east for 3 1/4 miles. The trail crosses the creek a couple of times but bridges are provided so this route is suitable for high water conditions or those looking to enjoy a nice hike. From the Quarry Trailhead follow the trail east for 3/4 mile to the Power Plant (N40° 34' 15\", W111° 45' 37\"), continue past the Power Plant for 1/4 mile and you will encounter the First Bridge (N40° 34' 17\", W111° 45' 19\"). 1/4 mile past the First Bridge you will encounter an Old Pavilion (N40° 34' 14\", W111° 45' 03\"), 1/2 mile past the Old Pavilion you will encounter the Old Power Plant (N40° 34' 16\", W111° 44' 33\"). This is the Old Power Plant you begin hiking from if using the standard route. 1/4 mile past the Old Power Plant you will locate the Little Cottonwood Canyon Pictographs (N40° 34' 14\", W111° 44' 19\") inside Slide Rock Cave. For those completing the full Little Cottonwood Canyon Trail 1/2 mile past the pictographs you will encounter the Second Bridge (N40° 34' 14\", W111° 43' 55\"). 3/4 mile past the Second Bridge you will reach trails end at the Power Plant Ruins (N40° 34' 14\", W111° 43' 01\") Video: Enjoy a short video from Little Cottonwood Canyon Pictographs. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/llcpic.htm 1/25/2018 Little Cottonwood Canyon Pictographs - Fremont Indian Rock Art Page 4 of 4 [ Homepage ] [

Parrish Canyon Pictographs Wasatch Mountains Hiking & Rock Art When I first heard that a pristine panel of rock art existed only a few minutes away from a major population center in northern Utah my first thought was \"No way, I don't believe it\", but it's true. The panel of rock art is very nice and easy to access. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: The Parrish Canyon Pictographs are a terrific way for the family to spend an afternoon together. The hike is less than 1 mile round trip and will require approximately 30 minutes each way, This adventure is accessible year round. Everyone in your group should carry at least one liter of water. A GPS is not really required, but the waypoints are provided for the gizmo junkies in the crowd. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Bountiful Peak\" shows the area described. The USGS map is out of date and the roads and trails in the area are not shown correctly. Navigation for this route is easy if you follow the route description provided. The hike to the Parrish Canyon Pictographs is rated 1A I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: This trailhead is located in Centerville, Utah. From I-15 take Exit 319, which will deposit you on Parrish Lane (400 North). Turn east on Parrish Lane and follow the road for 1.1 miles to a tee. Turn north (left) on the small paved road signed \"Bonneville Shoreline Trail\". Follow the small paved road for 0.2 miles to the Parrish Canyon Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify as it contains parking for a dozen vehicles and a kiosk located at the north end of the parking area. There are no restrooms at the trailhead. The Parrish Canyon Trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Warning: Sections of this route pass near gardens of poison ivy. The poison ivy is easy to avoid if you know what it looks like. Poison ivy has three leaves and is frequently found near water. Poison ivy leaves are green in the summer and red in the fall. Educate yourself before attempting this route. Route Information: From the Parrish Canyon Trailhead (N40° 55' 21\", W111° 51' 59\"), locate the trail heading east that begins at the kiosk. Hike east on the trail, up the hill, for 200-yards to a major 4-way trail junction (N40° 55' 20\", W111° 51' 53\"). The trail leading north-south is the Bonneville Shoreline Trail (BST). Turn north (left) and follow the Bonneville Shoreline Trail for 250-yards to a bridge crossing the stream in Parrish Canyon (N40° 55' 26\", W111° 51' 49\"). At the north end of the bridge locate a use trail that follows the creek upstream (east). The use trail is not maintained, but it is not difficult to follow or hike if you look for the path of least resistance. Follow the use trail east for 250-yards to a large rock outcropping, when you pass a small forest service sign noting the rock art you are approximately 30-yards from reaching the pictographs. The last 30-yards of trail require a small amount of scrambling. You have two choices, you can scramble 20-feet along the face of the rock outcropping or you can descend 20- feet to the stream and walk right up the bottom of the riverbed, pick your poison. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/parrish.htm 1/25/2018 Parrish Canyon Pictographs - Hiking & Rock Art Page 2 of 2 On the east side of the rock outcropping you will see a rock overhang with what appears to be red paint below. Walk up to the red paint and the Parrish Canyon Pictographs (N40° 55' 27\", W111° 51' 40\") will come into focus. Please do not touch or disturb the pictographs.

The petroglyphs were in all probability created by the Timpanogotzis (or Tumpanowach) American Indian tribe that lived along the banks of the Provo River. This amazing collection of native American rock art provides a perfect afternoon adventure for the entire family. General Information: The Provo Canyon Petroglyphs are located on a bench above the Provo River. The collection of rock art consists of a couple dozen symbols etched into several large boulders. The petroglyphs are accessible year round in good weather. Spring, summer and fall are the ideal times for this hike. The petroglyphs could be difficult to reach during snowy periods. Provo Canyon Petroglyphs are rated 1A II using the Canyon Rating System. A round trip hike to visit the petroglyphs will require approximately 2 hours. This will allow a reasonable amount of time to explore. The more you explore the more petroglyphs you will uncover. Every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of one liter of water. The trail to the petroglyphs is approximately 3/4 miles each way and has a 500-foot elevation gain. A GPS is extremely useful in locating petroglyphs. The USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Bridal Veil Falls\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is easy and follows a trail most of the way. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. From 1-15 in Orem Utah take Exit 272 (800 North) and head east. Follow 800 North east for 4.9 miles to a Y-Junction. Take the north (left) fork onto US 189 (Provo Canyon Road). Follow US 189 east into Provo Canyon for 2.5 miles to the signed Canyon Glen Park located on the north (left) side of the highway. This is the Provo Canyon Petroglyphs Trailhead. The trailhead is easy to identify as it consists of a large paved parking area next to the highway. Canyon Glen Park contains picnic tables, barbeque pits and restrooms. Route Information: From the Provo Canyon Petroglyphs Trailhead (N40° 19' 46\", W111° 37' 16\"), use the footbridge to cross the Provo River and follow the paved trail north for 150-yards to where it Tees. Turn east (right) and follow the trail for 100-yards to a Y-junction with a drinking fountain located on the north (left) side of the trail. Behind the drinking fountain you will see a dirt trail climbing north up the mountain. This is the trail you want to follow as it zigzags up the side of the mountain. The trail is braided in a few places, just follow the most well used (easiest) trail. Soon the trail will reach a dirt road, which is the aqueduct pipeline. Hike east (right) on the aqueduct road for 15-yards and you will see where the trail you have been following continues up the side of the mountain. Continue following the trail up the mountain for a short distance to where it flattens out on top of a ridge at a four-way junction (N40° 19' 55\", W111° 37' 24\"). At the four-way junction turn east (right) and follow the trail up the hill for 300-yards to where the trail turns north (left). At this point you should see several large boulders on the side http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/provorockart.htm 1/25/2018 Provo Canyon Petroglyphs - Hiking & Rock Art Page 2 of 2 of the hill to the east. The Provo Canyon Petroglyphs are located on these boulders (N40° 20' 01\", W111° 37' 15\"). The more you explore the more rock art you will discover. Don't forget to check out some of the smaller boulders as we found petroglyphs on rocks of all sizes. Provo River History: The Provo River was originally named the Timpanogotzis (or Tumpanowach) after the American Indian tribe living on its banks. Early settlers changed the name to Provo, after trapper Etienne Provost, for whom the city of Provo, Utah is also named. The old name for the river was instead given to the mountain to the north, which later became known as Mount Timpanogos.

] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Lake Solitude Loop Mill F Big Cottonwood Canyon Wasatch Mountains Hiking The Lake Solitude Loop Hike is a fun and entertaining trail. The route is very picturesque, visits several high alpine lakes. The only draw back is you spend most of your time hiking around the Solitude and Brighton Ski Resorts. This means you are often hiking under and around ski lifts and this detracts from the wilderness feeling. The one bonus is you can often find some great booty dropped by skiers if you do this route just after the snow melts. General Information: The Lake Solitude Loop is a nice hike in the Wasatch Mountains. The route visits three lakes. The basic loop is 4 miles around and will require approximately 3 to 4 hours. The route contains 880 feet of elevation gain. All hikers in your party should carry a minimum of one liter of water. Water is plentiful in this area, but all water taken from lakes and streams should be filtered before drinking. Insect repellent is a good idea as mosquitoes can be bothersome during certain times of the year. A mosquito repellent that contains DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is highly recommended. Navigation for this route is moderate. The area is criss-crossed with trails and ski resort access roads so paying attention to your map and route description is required. The one bonus is mistakes in navigation are easy to overcome and correct. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Brighton\" are helpful. You might also find a map of the Solitude Ski Resort useful. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. It should be noted that the USGS maps are not accurate for trails in this area. Numerous trails including the Lake Solitude Loop are not shown correctly. The trails are correctly located on the map provided. This route is suitable for beginners and rated 1 II using the Yosemite Decimal System. Big Cottonwood Canyon is within Salt Lake City Watershed, therefore special restrictions apply and are strictly enforced. No domestic animals (dogs, cats, horses) are permitted in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Trailhead Information: From anywhere in the Salt lake Valley take I-215 East until you reach the 6200 South Exit (Exit 6). Signs are marked for the ski areas, you will be heading towards Brighton and Solitude Ski Resorts. Drive east on 6200 south and the road will become Wasatch Boulevard. Follow Wasatch Boulevard south to an intersection with Fort Union Boulevard (7200 South). The intersection is located 1.7 miles after exiting I-215. All mileage is taken from the intersection of Wasatch Boulevard and Fort Union Boulevard. This is known locally as the \"Mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon\". There is a large Park and Ride lot with restrooms located near the north east corner of the intersection. From the intersection drive east up Big Cottonwood Canyon. After driving 14.2 miles up canyon the road will fork into a one-way loop. follow the one-way loop right (west) and drive 50 http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/solitude.htm 1/25/2018 Lake Solitude Loop - Big Cottonwood Canyon - Hiking Page 2 of 2 yards to the signed Silver Lake Trailhead on the right (north) side of the road. The trailhead is designated with a large paved parking lot, restroom, information kiosk and visitor center. The Silver Lake Trailhead is the beginning of several popular hikes. Route Information: From the Silver Lake Trailhead (N40° 36' 13\", W111° 35' 03\") you need to hike to the north side of Silver Lake. You can hike around the lake in either direction, but counter clockwise is the shortest route at 1/3 mile. On the north side of Silver Lake you will encounter a major unsigned junction (N40° 36' 18\", W111° 35' 20\") with a trail leading north. Follow the trail north for 150 yards to a second unsigned junction (N40° 36' 21\", W111° 35' 22\"). The trail to the west (left) leads to Twin Lakes and is the trail you will descend at the completion of the loop. For now, continue north (straight ahead) and follow the trail as it gradually climbs through the aspen and fir forest and crosses the Solbright Ski Run. The trail continues climbing and soon crosses under Solitude's Sunrise Ski Lift. The trail then turns south into the Mill F drainage, crosses two more ski runs, and climbs to Lake Solitude (N40° 36' 17\", W111° 35' 58\"). The hike to Lake Solitude is not difficult and accessible to most. The trail beyond Lake Solitude becomes more difficult because of the elevation gain. The weak and timid might want to turn back here. On the west side of Lake Solitude is the Summit Lift access road. Follow the road south as it climbs steeply to Solbright Pass (N40° 35' 58\", W111° 36' 00\"). From the pass you should have a great view looking down on Twin Lakes. Follow the Solbright Ski Trail as it descends towards the Twin lakes Dam and the top of the Evergreen Ski Lift (N40° 35' 55\", W111° 35' 44\"). At this point the route crosses the Granite Lakes Loop Hike. You could combine these two trails into a full day hike. From the top of the Evergreen Lift you should be able to locate a large sign pointing the way to the Solbright Trail. This is also the old access road to the Twin Lakes Dam. Follow the Solbright Trail as it swings north and begins to descend. You will soon be presented with a great view of Silver Lake from above. Just after you cross under the cliffs above Silver Lake the Solbright Ski Trail branches off to the north (left). Just keep following the access road down toward Silver Lake.

The Willard rock art paintings are all from one era, the Fremont, who inhabited the top half of Utah from roughly A.D. 1000 to 1300. Each site has a dozen separate figures, half of which could be missed by an untrained eye. A trip to visit these pictographs is worth the effort. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints. General Information: Willard Pictographs are located in five caves above Willard Bay. Each cave contains about a dozen paintings, most of which have been ravished by time. These Fremont pictographs have suffered over the last 30 years, the wet years in the middle of the 1980's took a severe toll on many of these pictographs. The pictographs are accessible year round in good weather. Spring, winter and fall are the ideal times for this hike. A round trip hike to visit the pictographs requires approximately 3 hours, depending on how much exploring you do while in the area. The route is approximately 2 miles each way with 600-feet of elevation gain. Most of the route follows a well defined trail, but to reach the individual caves you will be required to scramble over steep loose rock. I do not recommend this route for children or seniors. Every member of your hiking party should carry a minimum of one liter of water. A GPS is extremely useful in locating the pictographs. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Willard\" and \"Plain City\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. Willard Pictographs are rated 2A II using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: From Ogden, Utah drive north on I-15 towards the town of Willard. Take Exit #351 and follow the signs north towards Willard. You will soon find yourself traveling north on Highway 89. 2.8 miles after exiting the freeway you will reach 7425 South. Turn right on 7425 South and drive east for 0.4 miles until the road ends. This is the Willard Pictograph Trailhead. The trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. Route Information: There are several trails leading away from the trailhead. It can be a little confusing but most of the trails lead to the same place. When standing at the trailhead look east-northeast and you will see a large high voltage power transmission pole about 1/4 mile away. The power pole is is your first destination. The power line follows a canal along the bench from ancient Lake Bonneville. From the Willard Pictograph Trailhead (N41° 22' 29\", W112° 01' 32\") follow the buried pipeline north for a short distance to the top of a rise, and than follow a trail east to the base of the power pole and the bank of the canal. There is a dirt road that follows the canal. Hike north on the dirt road for a short distance and you will reach a siphon (N41° 22' 40\", W112° 01' 29\") where the canal crosses under a small drainage. At the siphon you can cross the canal using a trail, immediately on the east side of the canal the trail splits. Follow the north (left) fork and enjoy your hike. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/willard.htm 1/25/2018 Willard Pictographs - Wasatch Mountains - Hiking & Rock Art Page 2 of 2 Follow the trail north, it will make one large zigzag as it climbs to the 4800' level of ancient Lake Bonneville and continues north. Approximately 1 1/4 miles after leaving the siphon you will cross a rock drainage that will have a small flowing stream in the spring. Just before you cross the drainage look up on the mountain side and about 200' up you will see Large Alcove (N41° 23' 09\", W112° 01' 20\"), it is easy to see from the trail. To reach Large Alcove hike past it to the north on the trail, and scramble up the small ridge between two scree fields. About two-thirds of the way up the ridge you will encounter Small Alcove (N41° 23' 10\", W112° 01' 22\"). Both Small Alcove and Large Alcove have about a dozen figures. If you have an untrained eye look for what looks like red paint, once you find the red paint the figures will start to come into focus. Large Alcove is the most difficult of the panels listed to reach. Once you have explored Large and Small Alcove return to the trail and hike north 150- yards. You will see a rock ledge about 150' up. Devil Man (N41° 23' 13\", W112° 01' 23\") is located on this rock ledge. The easiest way to reach the pictograph is to hike past it to the north and scramble up the north side of the scree field. As you near Devil Man you will find a large alcove that was hidden from view when you were on the trail. Devil Man is located just to the south of the alcove. You will also find other pictographs if you look under the ledges. Once you have explored Devil Man return to the trail and hike north 200-yards. As the trail approaches a large outcropping look directly east and you will see two small caves stack one on top of the other. The upper cave is known as Snake Cave (N41° 23' 20\", W112° 01' 24\") and is filled with pictographs. It's a little difficult for one person to climb inside the cave. But two people offering a little help should not have an issue. After exploring Snake Cave return to the trail and hike 50-yards to the north side of the rock outcropping. Not far off the trail in the north wall of the rock outcropping is North Alcove (N41° 23' 21\", W112° 01' 26\"). This is the least interesting of the rock art as it is extremely weathered and faded. It is difficult to make out what most of the paintings were at one time as most are not just red spots on the wall. This is the easiest of the alcoves to explore. There is a sixth cave said to contain painted bird tracks, humans, snakes and other animals nearby but we were not able to locate it. In all it is supposed to contain about 15 figures etched in a cave accessible by a short, moderately difficult scramble. History: Fremont Indians farmed much of the land around the Great Salt Lake, especially where streams entered. The population peaked in the 1100s, and farming ceased during a serious drought in the 1300s. Archaeologists debate whether Shoshones and other American Indians descended from the Fremont or if the people moved or died at the end of the civilization. Shoshone tradition links them with the Fremont. The early Mormons gravitated to the same fertile areas inhabited by the Fremont. The remains of Fremont villages lie under Ogden, Willard, Farmington and nearly every other early Mormon settlement. A large Fremont village that survived the early settlement period was bulldozed during the creation of Willard Bay, and smaller sites were lost to Interstate 15, but the rugged hunting camps above have remained immune to development.

In 2001, Salt lake City in partnership with Utah Open Lands, Utah Quality Growth Commission and United Park City Mines Company purchased 155 acres in Big Cottonwood Canyon. The area will forever be preserved in a conservation easement for watershed protection, wildlife habitat and recreation. The scenery along the trail is outstanding in any season. The fall foliage, with the canyon maples and the aspens is spectacular.This is a great hike for beginners and children. General Information: Willow Heights is a fun and entertaining hike. This is one of the best novice hikes in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Willow Heights consists of a beautiful lake located in the middle of a forest. The trail to Willow Heights is 3/4 mile one-way and it will require approximately 30 to 45 minutes to reach the lake from the trailhead. This is a new trail that was established in 2001. The well maintained trail is not part of the Forest Service Trail System. All hikers in your party should carry a minimum of one liter of water. Water is plentiful in this area, but all water taken from lakes and streams should be filtered before drinking. Insect repellent is a good idea as mosquitos can be bothersome during certain times of the year. A mosquito repellent that contains DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is highly recommended. The route contains no real obstacles. This route is suitable for beginners and children. Willow Heights is rated 1 I using the Yosemite Decimal System. Navigation for this route is easy. A GPS is useful in identifying waypoints and verifying your location. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Park City West\" is helpful. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. It should be noted that due to new trail construction and trail realignment the USGS maps are not accurate in relation to trail location. The trails are correctly located on the map provided. Big Cottonwood Canyon is within Salt Lake City Watershed, therefore special restrictions apply and are strictly enforced. No domestic animals (dogs, cats, horses) are permitted in Big Cottonwood Canyon. During the winter months the Willow Heights is an excellent snowshoe and cross country skiing destination. Avalanche danger should always be a major priority and proper precautions should be taken when enjoying Utah's winter wonderland. Trailhead Information: From anywhere in the Salt lake Valley take I-215 East until you reach the 6200 South Exit (Exit 6). Signs are marked for the ski areas, you will be heading towards Brighton and Solitude Ski Resorts. Drive east on 6200 south and the road will become Wasatch Boulevard. Follow Wasatch Boulevard south to an intersection with Fort Union Boulevard (7200 South). The http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/willow.htm 1/25/2018 Willow Heights - Big Cottonwood Canyon - Hiking Page 2 of 2 intersection is located 1.7 miles after exiting I-215. All mileage is taken from the intersection of Wasatch Boulevard and Fort Union Boulevard. This is known locally as the \"Mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon\". There is a large Park and Ride lot with restrooms located near the north east corner of the intersection. From the intersection drive east up Big Cottonwood Canyon. After driving 11.8 miles you will reach the Willow Heights Trailhead (0.4 miles up canyon from the Silver Fork Lodge). The only item to identify the trailhead is a 35 MPH speed warning sign visible to down canyon traffic. A large white lettered boulder identifying the trailhead is visible behind the speed warning sign. The only parking available for this trailhead is on the wide, south side shoulder of Big Cottonwood Canyon Road. Please pull completely off the road and use caution crossing the road. Route Information: The Willow Heights Trail begins next to a large white boulder (N40° 37' 49\", W111° 36' 16\") lettered \"Willow Heights Conservation Area\". Just follow the well maintained trail as it begins to climb north up the side of the mountain and passes near an information kiosk. The first 1/4 mile of trail is the steepest. The trail eases up for the second 1/4 mile and in nearly flat for the finial 1/4 mile. The trail soon reaches the lovely Willow Heights Lake (N40° 38' 11\", W111° 35' 50\"). The lake and surrounding area obviously has a healthy beaver population. The beaver lodge located in the the center of the lake and surrounding dam and channel work is something special to admire. Optional Information: If you are looking for a little more adventure you can follow the less traveled trail that continues to climb up the drainage to Dry Lake (N40° 38' 28\", W111° 35' 32\"). This fun little detour will double the length of the hike.

National Park Technical Canyoneering Birch Hollow is one of those \"secret\" canyons that you always hear about, or at least it was. The canyon was kept concealed so the local rap-n-swim kiddie canyoneers would not bolt it. But like all good things this came to a heartbroken end when a couple of gumbies bolted the canyon. Even with the bolts that are despised elsewhere on the Colorado Plateau, Birch Hollow is still an extraordinary slot canyon worthy of descent. The canyon is located just outside the Zion National Park boundary. General Information: Birch Hollow is a technical canyoneering adventure, which will require 4 hours to complete. A car shuttle is not required for this adventure. You will need complete technical gear along with a 60 meter (200') rope, several slings and a minimum of 50 feet of webbing. Birch Hollow requires no swimming and only minor wading may be required. Please limit group size to 12 or less in this drainage as larger groups are becoming an issue with the local BLM. Birch Hollow faces federal restrictions if the voluntary group size is not adhere to. Clear Creek Mountain is the USGS 7.5 minute topographical map that shows Birch Hollow. Navigation for this adventure is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Birch Creek use the WGS84 datum. Always check your GPS to ensure that WGS84 is the datum before entering a waypoint into your unit. Birch Hollow is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. You do not need a Zion backcountry permit for this canyon. The canyon is located outside the National Park boundary. Birch Hollow has a moderate flash flood danger, check the weather report before attempting this route. Trailhead Information: From the East Entrance of Zion National Park, drive east 2.4 miles on highway 9. Turn left at the signed \"North Fork\" junction. Drive 8.5 miles to the Birch Hollow Trailhead. The first 5.5 miles of road are paved but the final 3.0 miles are on a well- maintained dirt road. There is no actual trailhead, just a few places where you can pull off the dirt road. The trailhead is easily identified as the place where the Birch Hollow drainage crosses the road. Any vehicle can be driven to the trailhead with no problems during dry conditions. This road becomes impassable to all vehicles (including four wheel drive) during wet conditions. There is no good camping in the immediate area. Route Information: From the Birch Hollow Trailhead (N37° 18' 35\", W112° 51' 23\"), begin hiking northwest down the drainage. Some bushwhacking will be required for the first 15 minutes. Shortly an ATV track enters the canyon bottom and makes the hiking easy. You might as well admire the ATV track because someone has put a lot of effort into its construction, including building a bridge and some nice rock work. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/birch.htm 1/25/2018 Birch Hollow - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Soon the ATV track is stopped by a 100-foot dryfall. This is bypassed on the west (left) side. Continue hiking down canyon and you will encounter a 75-foot dryfall, which can be rappelled or bypassed on the west (left) side. The bypass has some exposure. After the second dryfall the canyon begins to really slot up. The first obstacle is a 10-foot downclimb followed by a 15-foot downclimb. Next is a 30-foot rappel. Than you will encounter a 100-foot rappel, walk 20 feet to a 40-foot rappel. Next is a 35-foot rappel followed by an 8-foot downclimb followed by a 40-foot rappel. Shortly down canyon the final two rappels are encountered. The first is a 70-foot drop into a dirt-filled pothole, followed immediately by a 50-foot drop to the floor of Orderville Canyon. From the floor of Orderville Gulch (N37° 19' 24\", W112° 52' 33\") you must hike up canyon for 10 minutes to the junction of Orderville Gulch and Wild Wind Hollow (N37° 19' 28\", W112° 52' 14\"). You will pass a small side canyon coming in on the right (LUC) before encountering the Orderville Gulch and Wild Wind Hollow Junction. At the junction, the left fork heads to the Orderville Canyon Trailhead and the right fork heads up a brown clay drainage, which is often referred to as Wild Wind Hollow. Hike up the bottom of Wild Wind Hollow for 1/2 hour until stopped at a 30-foot dryfall. From the bottom of the dryfall exit the drainage to the right (LUC) heading up a small hill. At the top of the hill a very small drainage can be found. Follow this drainage upward, staying out of the large drainage on the left. Continue Scrambling and bushwhacking uphill for the next hour until the North Fork Road is encountered (N37° 18' 51\", W112° 51' 13\"). After reaching the North Fork road head south to the Birch Hollow Trailhead. Consider yourself warned, the last hour of bushwhacking up Wild Wind Hollow is brutal. You will want long pants and a long sleeve shirt as you will be breaking through thick brush. You might want to seriously consider the Optional Route Information noted below. Optional Route Information: Birch Hollow is a good canyon by itself. If you combine it with Orderville Gulch this is a fantastic adventure. Consider Birch Hollow the ultimate entrance to Orderville Gulch. Birch Hollow enters Orderville at the perfect spot and eliminates the unattractive slogging section of Orderville Gulch. The Birch Hollow/Orderville Gulch combination will require 8 to 10 hours to complete. A car spot is required for this adventure. Birch Hollow requires no swimming. However, if you use the Orderville Gulch/Zion Narrows exit route you will be wading for several miles with the possibility of several short swims. You might want something warm and dry to put on when you complete this canyon so throw a fleece in a drybag. Birch Hollow combined with the Orderville Gulch and Zion Narrows exit is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. You will need a Zion backcountry permit if you intend to descend Orderville Gulch, which is located inside the National Park boundary. Clear Creek Mountain and Temple of Sinawava are the USGS 7.5 minute topographical maps required if you do the Birch Hollow/Orderville Gulch combination. Navigation for this adventure is easy. The route for the Birch Hollow/Orderville Gulch combination is the same as the standard route with the exception of turning down canyon when you reach Orderville Gulch. It is 5 1/4 miles down Orderville to the junction with the Zion Narrows. Fortunately, this portion of the hike visits the best part of Orderville Gulch. There will be wading, possible swimming and downclimbing required in Orderville Gulch. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/birch.htm 1/25/2018 Birch Hollow - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 At the junction with the Zion Narrows just keep hiking downstream. You should begin meeting plenty of tourists at this point who have hiked up canyon. It is 2 1/2 miles down the Narrows to the Temple of the Sinawava and the shuttle bus. Optional Route Information #2: If you have a vehicle shuttle, but don't want to exit down Orderville Gulch, exiting up Orderville Gulch is the preferred route. The Wild Wind Hollow exit is a brutal bushwhack. Exiting up Orderville Gulch is nothing special, but it does eliminate the bushwhacking and replaces it with mostly road walking. The Down Birch Hollow and up Orderville Gulch exit requires approximately 4 hours. Video: Enjoy a short video of Birch Hollow. Video compliments of Blake Merrell.

In short, this canyon is everything you could ever ask for. Boundary Canyon is a unique and charming technical slot canyon. The technical section of canyon begins at the boundary of Zion National Park and if you haven't figured it out yet that is how the canyon received its name. The canyon is not identified on any official map. Boundary Canyon is a refreshing, lush and green slot canyon that is worth the effort to visit. This canyon offers several route options that allows the canyon to be experienced in a single day or extended into a phenomenal two day adventure. General Information: Boundary Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure that requires complete technical gear. Boundary Canyon is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 7 or 8 hours using the MIA Exit. That is if you have used the MIA Exit before. Plan on longer if this is your first opportunity to experience the delightful hell known as the MIA Exit. Boundary Canyon contains 7 rappels. The longest rappel in the canyon is 175- feet. The route requires two 60 meter ropes, several slings and a minimum of 75 feet of webbing. In normal years Boundary Canyon has a fairly strong flow of water from spring to mid-summer. From mid-summer to fall the water flow tapers off and completely disappears some years, while in other years the water flow might last through the season. The canyon contains no swimming or deep wading in normal conditions. Wet suits are required if the canyon contains flowing water because you will be rappelling down waterfalls and standing in spray. A Zion Backcountry Permit is not required for this route when using the MIA Exit because the technical section is outside of Zion National Park. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Kolob Reservoir\" and \"Cogswell Point\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Boundary Canyon use the WGS84 datum. In normal conditions, This canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. West Rim Trailhead: A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. From the Zion Canyon Visitor Center drive west on Highway 9 to the town of Virgin. From Virgin turn right (north) on the signed Kolob Reservoir Road. Travel 20.5 miles to the signed Lava Point/West Rim Trailhead turn-off. Turn right (east) and follow the signs on the well-maintained gravel road for 2.3 miles http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/boundary.htm 1/25/2018 Boundary Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 to the gate blocking the road and the signed West Rim Trailhead. The trailhead has parking available for a number of vehicles. Any vehicle can easily reach the trailhead in dry conditions. A very pleasant campground is available at Lava Point on a first come, first served bases. Route Information: From the West Rim Trailhead (N37° 22' 53\", W113° 01' 24\") pass around the gate and follow the MIA Road east for 3/4 mile to the top of a small knoll (N37° 23' 07\", W113° 00' 40\"). At this point you should have excellent views to the north down into Boundary Canyon. The idea is to find the best way to the bottom of the canyon and hike to the Zion National Park boundary (N37° 23' 30\", W113° 00' 02\"). The hike into the bottom of the canyon is not difficult with some minor route finding. Old logging roads can be used to make the trek easier. When you reach the park boundary cross over the fence, exit the park, and prepare to descend the technical section of Boundary Canyon. The first rappel is 175-feet and is the biggest rappel in the canyon. The canyon contains six more rappels all less than 100-feet in height. Enjoy the trip and keep your eyes open for natural bridges, the canyon contains an abundance of them. The technical section is short but sweet and ends with a 50-foot rappel. From the bottom of the final rappel enjoy a nice stroll down Boundary Canyon to it's junction with Kolob Canyon (N37° 23' 40\", W112° 59' 23\"). From the Boundary/Kolob Canyon confluence it requires approximately 40 minutes and 1 1/4 miles of steady, downstream, hiking to reach the MIA Exit (N37° 22' 46\", W112° 58' 56\"). The MIA Exit is often marked with a small cairn if you are lucky. Watch for Kolob Canyon to open slightly, with a minor drainage entering from the west (right) side, this is the infamous MIA Exit Route. The exit will be the first place on your west (right) side where you would even consider it possible to exit. This exit is easy to miss so pay attention to details. Currently there are several very large logs at the MIA Exit and a deep mulchy deposit and logjam immediately after it. The MIA Exit is not a trail or marked route but a weakness that allows access to the canyon rim. There is no correct path to follow but you will likely encounter several hiker made trails. The route is difficult with several sections of scrambling and loose rock. It will take those with good route finding skills approximately 90 minutes to reach the canyon rim and the MIA road. From the point where the MIA Drainage meets the floor of Kolob Canyon it is necessary to backtrack up canyon slightly and climb above a dryfall to the right (LUC). Once you are above the dryfall the route mostly follows the drainage bottom and bypasses dryfalls to the right and left as required. Stay in the main drainage until it begins to steepen up. At this point scramble left through a steep gambel oak forest and up to a small pass by a hoodoo. Note the drainage to your left (LUC) and below. Work your way down a sandy manzanita slope to this drainage and up to the base of an interesting little slot often referred to as the MIA Slot. From the bottom of the MIA Slot follow a drainage that veers slightly right (LUC) and extends to the canyon rim. At the top of the drainage you should intersect the MIA road (N37° 22' 49\", W112° 59' 27\"). At the MIA road begin hiking north for 1/4 mile to a split in the road (N37° 22' 59\", W112° 59' 33\"). Take the left (uphill) fork. Hike uphill for 1/4 mile to a junction (N37° 23' 05\", W112° 59' 44\") and take the road to the right. Hike for 1/2 mile with good views into Kolob Canyon to a junction (N37° 23' 09\", W112° 59' 34\") and take the road to the right. Hike for 1/2 mile to a gate and sign designating Zion Park boundary (N37° 23' 13\", http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/boundary.htm 1/25/2018 Boundary Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 W113° 00' 02\"). Continue following the road for an additional 1/4 mile to a junction (N37° 23' 05\", W113° 00' 14\") and take the road to the right. Follow the road for approximately 200 yards to a junction (N37° 23' 03\", W113° 00' 18\") and take the road to the right. The West Rim Trailhead is 1 mile ahead on the road you are now following. The road will pass over the small knoll you departed from earlier in the day. What is MIA? Since I am always asked what is MIA I thought I would tell you now and save you heathens from having to ask. MIA is a Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder Day Saints (Mormon) abbreviation for \"Mutual Improvement Association\". The church owns some of the private property on the West Rim of Zion and maintains a campsite that is used by church members. I bet you are happy that you know someone who can speak a little \"Mormonese\" to help you out in this foreign land. However, some who have used the exit in the past swear that MIA stands for \"Missing In Action\". Optional Narrows Exit: The most scenic exit route for Boundary Canyon is to spend two days and hike out the Zion Narrows to the Temple of Sinawava. This route can be completed in one very long day by a small group of experienced canyoneers and requires 10 to 12 hours. Completing the route in two days is traditional and allows for a more relaxing stroll or slightly larger group size. This is an excellent exit and I highly recommend using it at least once in your lifetime. If using the Narrows Exit a Zion Backcountry Permit must be obtained from the Zion Canyon Visitors Center. A car shuttle is required for this route option. Your shuttle vehicle must be left at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center and than drive to the West Rim Trailhead to begin your adventure. \"Kolob Reservoir\", \"Cogswell Point\" and \"Temple of Sinawava\" are the USGS 7.5 minute topographical maps needed to complete this route. Boundary Canyon with the Temple of Sinawava Exit is rated 3C V using the Canyon Rating System. To complete the Zion Narrows route you continue hiking down Kolob Canyon instead of climbing up the MIA Exit. The route contains one additional 15' rappel and a cold 30-foot swim. It requires approximately 3 hours to reach the Virgin River from the MIA Exit. Zion Narrows campsite #6 is located where Kolob Creek meets the Zion Narrows. Any campsite #6 through #12 is downstream and in the direction you need to go. Campsites #3, #4 and #5 are located a short distance up river at 5 minute intervals. You must register for a campsite when you pick up your backcountry permit. Any campsite #3 through #12 will meet your needs. All the sites are nice and each has something special to offer. Please be considerate and select a campsite that matches your group size. On a good day, which means clear water and low stream flow (less than 50 cfs), it will require 4 hours of hiking down the Virgin River from the Kolob confluence to reach the Temple of the Sinawava. This time estimate goes up exponentially with high and/or muddy river water. Optional Route: The technical section of Boundary Canyon is rather short and the MIA Exit is not really pleasant. Some consider descending Boundary Canyon and fixing ropes as a retreat to be the easiest method of visiting the canyon. To fix the canyon and climb back up your ropes you will need the following: (1) 180-foot rope, (3) 100-foot ropes, (2) 40-foot ropes and (1) 50-foot rope. Make certain of your rope lengths, if they are short you will not have enough rope. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/boundary.htm 1/25/2018 Boundary Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 4 of 4 Video: Enjoy a short video of Boundary Canyon in Zion National Park compliments of Blake Merrell.

This is one of the best canyons in Zion National Park and remained relatively hidden because of the brutal 3 1/2 hour bushwhacking approach that was required before the massive 2007 Dakota Hill Fire. Since the fire the approach is not as brutal. The canyon is very charming with three upper sections of mostly dry narrows and two lower sections of narrows that require wading and swimming. The exit hike is long but visits some of the best scenery inside Zion National Park. General Information: I'll make this simple for you, Checkerboard is easily one of the three best technical canyons in Zion National Park. Checkerboard Canyon is rated 3B IV using the Canyon Rating System. The route will require 12 to 13 hours to complete. The approach requires approximately 3 hours. The actual canyon requires approximately 5 hours and the exit requires an additional 3 1/2 hours. A long and time consuming car shuttle is also required for this adventure. You will need complete technical gear to complete this route. The longest rappel in the canyon is 195 feet and will require two 60 meter ropes, make certain your ropes are not short. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Checkerboard Canyon contains several short swims and miles of wading. A shortie wetsuit is a minimum requirement during hot weather. Cold weather will require a full wetsuit or drysuit. Because of the long route and time consuming shuttle it is suggested that shuttle vehicles be positioned, and permits obtained, the day before you attempt the route. Primitive camping is available at the trailhead. The key to success with this route is to begin hiking with the first rays of morning sunlight. Any other start time and you are likely doomed to failure. Small fast moving groups of experienced canyoneers will have the best results when assaulting this canyon. \"Clear Creek Mountain\" and \"Temple of Sinawava\" are the USGS 7.5 minute topographical maps that show Checkerboard Canyon. Navigation for this adventure is difficult. Before 2007 the approach required several hours of extreme bushwhacking, but the massive Dakota Hills Fire of 2007 eliminated some of the bushwhack. Since the fire a use trail has begun to develop for part of the approach. All waypoints and maps for Checkerboard Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Always check your GPS to ensure that WGS84 is the datum before entering a waypoint into your unit. A Zion backcountry permit is required for this canyon. Checkerboard Canyon has a high flash flood danger, check the weather report before attempting this route. Warning: If attempting this route before June you will might encounter debris fields of snow inside http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/checkboard.htm 1/25/2018 Checkerboard Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 the canyon that have avalanched from high above. This can create a dangerous situation. You have been warned! Lower Trailhead: The Lower Trailhead is located at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center. You will need to leave a shuttle vehicle there when you pick up your permit. Several local companies offer commercial shuttles for a very reasonable price. Upper Trailhead: From the Zion Canyon Visitor Center follow Highway 9 east through Zion National Park to the East Entrance Station. From the East Entrance Station continue driving east for 2.4 miles on Highway 9. Turn north (left) at the signed \"North Fork\" junction (N37° 14' 21\", W112° 49' 57\"). Drive 14.2 miles north (The first 5.5 miles of road are paved) until you reach the top of a ridge with a sharp right hand turn. Leading off the west (left) side of the turn is a rough spur road (N37° 21' 33\", W112° 50' 29\"). Follow the spur road for 1.1 miles until you encounter a campsite that will accommodate several vehicles under the trees. This is the trailhead. Passenger cars will have difficulty driving the spur road. High Clearance Vehicles and four wheel drives will have no problems in good weather. There are several nice campsite located along the spur road and at the trailhead. The North Fork Road becomes impassable to all vehicles (including four wheel drive) during wet conditions. Route Information: From the Checkerboard Canyon Trailhead (N37° 21' 08\", W112° 51' 33\"), follow the 4x4 track northwest. After 150-yards you will encounter a junction (N37° 21' 10\", W112° 51' 40\"), The west spur leads a short distance and ends. Take the northwest (right) track and follow the road. 1 mile from the trailhead the road will reach the shoulder of a ridge (N37° 21' 11\", W112° 52' 33\"), the track will begin to descend Walker Gulch. Do not descend the gulch, instead hike 3/4 miles along the ridge following a faint trail that leads first northwest and than southwest to cross over the prominent landmark known as Dakota Hill. From the top of Dakota Hill hike southwest downhill for 3/4 miles until you interest an ATV track that leads to a Hunters Camp (N37° 21' 02\", W112° 53' 47\"). From the hunters camp you must hike cross-country west-southwest for 1/2 miles to an old gate (N37° 20' 52\", W112° 54' 14\"). Finding the gate is not required since it is really a gate to no where, but the route to the gate used to eliminate some bushwhacking. From the gate hike in a westerly direction for 2 1/2 miles across the top of Bulloch Gulch to reach the head of Checkerboard Canyon (N37° 20' 48\", W112° 56' 05\"). The hike seems to work best if you swing in a wide arc north as you cross the minor upper tributaries of Bulloch Gulch. Bushwhacking across the head of Bulloch Gulch used to be brutal, enjoy the easy path the fire has now provided. Once you intersect Checkerboard canyon just hike downstream to the first rappel. The first rappel is 170-feet and is anchored from two bolts on the north wall. From here the fun really begins. The second rappel is approximately 120-feet and is a three tiered rappel between sand filled potholes. After that you will encounter about a dozen rappels in the 20 to 60 foot range. The canyon contains five distinct sections of slot. The three upper sections are usually dry and fun. The lower two sections are usually water filled, deep and dark. The canyon also contains several amazing slides into pools in the lower sections. Eventually you will reach the end of the canyon with its inevitable exit rappel. The exit rappel is 195-feet from two bolts on the south side of the canyon. Make certain your ropes are not short because it is a true 195-feet. The rappel itself is down a long narrow flute that deposits you in a hidden alcove (N37° 20' 39\", W112° 57' 04\") behind Camp #9 in the Zion Narrows. Once you have reached the narrows just follow the river downstream. 3/4 mile below Camp #9 you will meet Goose Creek (N37° 20' 18\", W112° 57' 26\") entering from the west. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/checkboard.htm 1/25/2018 Checkerboard Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 3/4 miles below the Goose Creek junction you will see Big Springs (N37° 19' 52\", W112° 57' 25\") spouting from the canyon wall. There is a small amount of poison ivy in the canyon between Goose Creek and Big Springs so use caution. The next 2 miles to the junction with Orderville Gulch (N37° 18' 28\", W112° 56' 48\") is the narrowest portion of \"The Narrows\". At the Orderville Gulch junction you should begin meeting a flock of tourists who have hiked up canyon from the Temple of the Sinawava. 1 1/4 miles below the junction with Orderville Gulch you will notice Mystery Falls (N37° 17' 57\", W112° 56' 40\") exiting from the hanging Mystery Canyon and flowing down the east side canyon wall. At this point the flock of tourists hiking up from the bottom has now turned into a thundering herd. 1 1/4 miles below Mystery Falls you will reach the Temple of the Sinawava (N37° 17' 07\", W112° 56' 52\") and the shuttle bus. Ride the shuttle bus back to the Lower Trailhead and your shuttle vehicle at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center.

The route is longer, technical, more difficult and more impressive than the Standard Subway Route, which penetrates the impressive canyon of the Left Fork of North Creek. Das Boot is a fantastic section of slot canyon that is inspiring by its self, but when combined with the Subway it is an incredible adventure. General Information: Das Boot is a technical canyoneering adventure. The route will require 8 to 10 hours to complete using the Subway exit. A car shuttle is required for this adventure. You will need a Zion Backcountry Permit to enter Das Boot. It advantageous to know that the Subway (and the Das Boot entrance) is limited to 50 visitors per day. Permits can be reserved three month's in advance. You will need complete technical gear to complete this route. The longest rappel in the canyon is 30 feet and will require a 60-foot rope. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. Das Boot contains an extensive amount of water in normal conditions and will require a great amount of swimming and wading. A full wetsuit or drysuit is suggest, even in hot weather. Das Boot is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. Navigation for this adventure is moderate since there is no trail. \"The Guardian Angels\" is the USGS 7.5 minute topographical map which shows the route. A GPS normally works in this canyon to help identify all important route junctions and the exit trail. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Left Fork Trailhead: After picking up your Zion Backcountry Permit at the main Zion Canyon Visitor Center drive 14 miles west on Highway 9 to the town of Virgin. Turn north (right) on the signed Kolob Reservoir Road. Travel 8.1 miles to the signed Left Fork Trailhead. The trailhead is on the east (right) side of the road and contains a large dirt parking lot, pit toilet and information kiosk. The Left Fork Trailhead is where you will finish the route. Park a shuttle vehicle at this trailhead. Wildcat Trailhead: From the Left Fork Trailhead hitch a ride or drive 7.2 miles further up the road to the signed Wildcat Canyon Trailhead. The trailhead is on the south (right) side of the road and contains a large dirt parking lot, pit toilet and information kiosk. The Wildcat Trailhead is where you begin the route. Both trailheads are reached by paved road and are accessible to any vehicle in good weather. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/boot.htm 1/25/2018 Das Boot - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Shuttle Information: Trailhead shuttle information is available. Route Information: From the Wildcat Trailhead (N37° 20' 24\", W113° 04' 32\"), follow the trail east for 1 mile to a junction with the Wildcat Canyon Connector trail (N37° 20' 23\", W113° 03' 43\"), turn east (left) at the junction and follow the trail for 300 yards to the junction with the Northgate Peaks spur trail. (N37° 20' 25\", W113° 03' 35\"), turn south (right) and follow the Northgate Peaks spur trail south for 200 yards until you encounter a hiker made trail (N37° 20' 21\", W113° 03' 34\") forking off to the east (left) and descending towards Russell Gulch. The trail is easy to find and is signed with information about \"Permit required to descend Left Fork\". This is also the standard entrance route to the famous Subway. Follow the prominent, unmaintained but well cairned trail for approximately 1/2 mile and than begin veering more to the north (left) of the standard Subway route. It is best to cross Russell Gulch slightly higher than the standard Subway trail. At the point where you actually cross Russell Gulch (N37° 20' 03\", W113° 02' 50\") look to the east and you will notice a prominent and very wide ledge system part way up the mountain. The simplest route is to gain this ledge system and hike it out to the south until you reach the rim of the Left Fork (N37° 19' 42\", W113° 02' 23\"). The view from this perch is impressive. From the impressive view perch begin working your way down into the Left Fork. As you descend in a southerly direction you want to keep veering to the east (left) when presented with an option. This should deposit you at the entrance to Das Boot (N37° 19' 19\", W113° 01' 54\"). If you reach the edge of Das Boot and find a short rappel from a pine tree with a sling is required to reach the actual bottom of the canyon, look behind the bushes to the west and you will find a walk down entrance. From the entrance to Das Boot let the fun begin. The route contains lots of swimming, wading, several downclimbs and probably three rappels, all less than 25-feet, depending on your skills. You will spend 1 to 2 hours in the actual Das Boot section of canyon. Das Boot ends at a 25-foot waterfall that can be rappelled, downclimbed or jumped. If you intend to jump the final obstacle you must have a spotter below check out the plunge pool. The pool contains hazards, you have been warned. The rappel anchor is a chokestone located in the watercourse. From the waterfall rappel hike downstream 50-yards and you will encounter Russell Gulch (N37° 19' 07\", W113° 02' 21\") entering from the north (right) side. Russell Gulch is the Standard Subway Entrance. If you are finished for the day you can exit out the Standard Subway Route. But that is not nearly as much fun as continuing down through the Subway. From Russell Gulch follow the Left Fork downstream as the standard Subway route begins. The next major obstacle is a large boulder. Experienced canyoneers can downclimb the front of the boulder. There is a route around the north (right) side of the boulder that looks inviting but that is the worst of the options and requires an awkward rappel. The best way around the boulder is to look over against the south (left) canyon wall. If you look carefully you will notice a large hole that you can downclimb through. The hole is somewhat hidden and is overlooked by most parties, but finding the hole will make this obstacle easy to bypass. Continue downstream. There are several pools to swim and obstacles to downclimb. 1 mile below the junction of Russell Gulch and Left Fork you will encounter Keyhole Falls (N37° 18' 42\", W113° 03' 05\"). This is the upper end of The Subway. Keyhole falls will require a rope for a handline. Anchor the handline to the bolts on the north (right) side of the canyon. This should lead you into the beautiful Upper Subway section. Continue downstream and you will soon encounter anther small cliff that blocks most hikers coming up from the bottom. Walk to the south (left) side of the cliff and set up a handline from two easy to locate bolts. This will deposit you in the Lower Subway section. This is the end of the difficult obstacles. Explore the area, if you hike and swim back under the waterfall you will find a small hidden room. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/boot.htm 1/25/2018 Das Boot - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 The actual Subway is only 1/4 mile long. 1/4 mile below Keyhole Falls you will exit the lower end of The Subway (N37° 18' 32\", W113° 03' 07\"). The remainder of the hike involves wading and boulder hopping. The canyon opens up and remains extremely scenic for the next couple of miles. The hike out contains several beautiful cascades over red rock formations, high sandstone cliffs and a lush, green canyon bottom. 1 1/2 miles below the Subway you will notice some excellent Dinosaur tracks (N37° 17' 58\", W113° 04' 12\") if you are paying attention. Several slabs of light gray mudstone are covered with dinosaur tracks. The stone is a fossilized lakebed from the Kayenta Formation, containing tracks laid down in the early Jurassic Period. The tracks belong to a bipedal carnivore. If you are looking at the ground you will not see the tracks. The slabs are located about 15 feet from the river, on the north side. There are 3 slabs approximately 30 feet wide by 20 high, tilted at a 45-degree angle. 1/2 mile below the dinosaur tracks Little Creek joins from the north (N37° 17' 43\", W113° 04' 41\"). 1/4 mile beyond Little Creek and Pine Springs Wash joins from the north (N37° 17' 35\", W113° 04' 51\"). 1/4 mile below Pine Springs Wash you must exit the canyon to the north (N37° 17' 22\", W113° 05' 05\"). The exit route is signed at the river \"Left Fork Trailhead\". The climb out has an elevation change of 400 feet as you climb up a very steep gully to the top of the lava cliffs. 3/4 mile after leaving the stream and after you have climbed out of the canyon the trail crosses Grapevine Wash. From Grapevine Wash it is only 200 yards to the Left Fork Trailhead (N37° 17' 05\", W113° 05' 47\"). Optional Route: If a car shuttle is not available or if time is limited you can exit up Russell Gulch using the standard Subway Approach and return to the Wildcat Trailhead. The route using this option is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. This will require 5 to 6 hours and does not require a vehicle shuttle.

Englestead Hollow Zion National Park Technical Canyoneering Englestead Hollow remained hidden from canyoneers for years and has only recently become a popular route. The deep slot was no secret to local residents. The entrance to the canyon requires a Big Wall start and the canyon is descended using mostly natural anchors, which makes this route unsuitable for inexperienced canyoneers. General Information: Englestead Hollow is a technical canyoneering adventure, which will require 7 to 8 hours to complete. A car spot is required for this adventure. You will require complete technical gear along with two 60 meter ropes, several slings and a drybag for your gear. The route contains a Big Wall rappel and 9 or 10 short rappels. Leave your bolt kit at home. There are plenty of natural anchors at every rappel with the exception of the Big Wall entrance, the Big Wall is well bolted. Bring 50 feet of extra webbing and several rappel rings and you can eliminate the extra weight of a bolt kit. Temple of Sinawava is the USGS 7.5 minute topographical map that shows Englestead Hollow. Navigation for this adventure is moderate. Englestead Hollow requires no swimming and very little wading. However, if you use the Orderville Gulch/Zion Narrows exit route, which is described you will be wading for several miles with several short swims. The water is cold and a wet suit is advised during cool weather. We did this canyon on a 100 degree day in St. George and never became chilled. You might want something warm and dry to put on when you complete this canyon so throw a fleece into your drybag. I suggest a group size of four or less. Englestead Hollow combined with the Orderville Gulch and Zion Narrows exit is rated 4B III using the Canyon Rating System. You will need a Zion backcountry permit for this canyon. Englestead Hollow has a high flash flood danger, check the weather report at the Visitor Center when you pick up your permit. Trailhead Information: From the East Entrance of Zion National Park, drive east 2.4 miles on highway 9. Turn left at the signed \"North Fork\" junction. Drive 5.2 miles to signed \"Zion Ponderosa Resort\". Turn left and enter the Zion Ponderosa (N37° 16' 22\", W112° 52' 24\"). From here, you will be driving on dirt roads. The Zion Ponderosa is private property, please respect this trailhead access. You will be crossing cabin sites with many spur roads, stay on the main road until told to turn off. You will be heading toward the Observation Point Trailhead. After entering the Zion Ponderosa, stay on the main road and drive 0.7 miles to signed Cable Mountain, Observation Point road fork (N37° 16' 33\", W112° 53' 02\"). Take the right fork and drive 0.7 miles to a tee in the road (N37° 16' 47\", W112° 53' 45\"). Turn right, and drive 1.1 miles until road forks around a large ponderosa pine (N37° 17' 43\", W112° 53' 49\"). Take the right fork and drive 0.2 miles to a spur road on the left (N37° 17' 51\", W112° 54' 00\"). This spur road leads to the East Mesa/Observation Point Trailhead. Do not take the spur road but continue straight on the main road for an additional 0.2 miles to where a road joins from the right. Park anywhere that is convenient as there are no signs at the trailhead (N37° 18' 01\", W112° 53' 58\"). In fact, there is no trailhead, just a few places where you can pull off the dirt road. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/englestead.htm 1/25/2018 Englestead Hollow - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Route Information: From the trailhead (N37° 18' 01\", W112° 53' 58\"), hike east over the hill. This section of the hike requires some bushwhacking since there is no trail. We did stumble upon an ATV track, which we were able to follow for a short distance. You will shortly begin dropping into a drainage, this is Englestead Hollow. You will be rewarded with views of your intended canyon after hiking less than 1/2 mile. As you approach the canyon your destination becomes more obvious. Just before the head of Englestead Hollow you will encounter a cliff band that will probably require a 50-foot rappel. The entrance to Englestead Hollow (N37° 18' 19\", W112° 53' 29\") is a 285-foot dry fall or Big Wall. The Big Wall is located 3/4 mile from the trailhead. The Big Wall is divided into two sections (possibly three sections for short ropes). The first section is an 80-foot rappel from a Ponderosa Pine to a 6\" cornerstance with two bolts. The second section is a 200-foot rappel to the canyon floor (our 60 meter climbing ropes reach just perfect with rope stretch). The entire Big Wall route is clearly visible if you walk around the head of the canyon and look in. It is only common sense that you visually locate the corner bolt station before committing to the entrance rappel. Approximately 20 feet above the canyon bottom there is a bolt station on a very large ledge with a pothole. I have always been able to bypass this bolt station when using 60 meter ropes. If you find your ropes will not quite reach the canyon bottom you can bring everyone down to the pothole ledge before continuing down canyon. From the ledge it is easy to see if your ropes reach or if you will need to reset your ropes to complete the entrance rappel. After the Big Wall entrance, the third rappel is 40 feet from a sling around a rock. The fourth rappel is 30 feet from a sling wrapped around a rock, past a long sling on a large log. The fifth rappel is 110 feet from the long sling attached to the log. Combine a short drop into a pothole with a long drop down a beautifully fluted wall. This rappel often provides a difficult rope pull so be prepared and spend a little extra time setting up your rappel. The remaining canyon contains 5 or 6 short rappels of less than 35 feet. Near the junction with Orderville Gulch there is a long rappel that can be avoided by climbing over the edge on the left side (LDC) and using a ledge system to reach the bottom of Orderville Gulch (N37° 18' 52\", W112° 54' 22\"). After you reach Orderville Gulch head down canyon. It is 3 miles to the junction with the Zion Narrows. Fortunately, this portion of the hike visits the best part of Orderville Gulch. Their will be wading and swimming required in Orderville Gulch. At the junction with the Zion Narrows (N37° 18' 28\", W112° 56' 48\") just keep hiking downstream. You should begin meeting plenty of tourists at this point who have hiked up canyon. It is 2 1/2 miles down the Narrows to the Temple of the Sinawava (N37° 17' 07\", W112° 56' 52\") and the shuttle bus. 285' Big Wall Rappel Notes: Consider this rappel carefully, this is not a route for beginners. The rappel can be made safer if you use a 300-foot rope for the entrance rappel into this canyon. If you intend to stage canyoneers down the Big Wall they must all have the proper gear and knowledge to correctly tie in and transfer rappels on their own at the mid-station. The following is a suggested method for quickly moving a group down the Big Wall. The first person down rappels to the corner-stance bolt station. The group on top lowers the end of the second rope with a locking carabiner attached to the end. The person at the corner-stance http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/englestead.htm 1/25/2018 Englestead Hollow - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 clips the carabiner to the anchor and the second rope is tossed over the edge from the top. The first person down now rappels the second rope to the canyon bottom. The remaining members of your party rappel to the corner-stance, transfer ropes and rappel to the canyon floor. The last person in your party rappels to the corner station, ties the top rope into the bottom rope to act as a retrieval line and than pulls the top rope. The last person than rappels to the canyon floor. Video: Enjoy a short video of Englestead in Zion National Park compliments of Blake Merrell.

The canyon is located just outside the boundaries of Zion National Park, which eliminates the bureaucratic hassles associated with neighboring canyons. This canyon is spring fed and provides a special treat to Colorado Plateau canyoneers in the form of flowing water. The stream flow is usually mild and provides a good introduction into wet canyons. Oak Creek is a sparkling and thrilling slot canyon that is certainly worth the effort to visit. This canyon offers several route options that allows the canyon to be experienced in a single day or extended into a phenomenal two day adventure. Interested in viewing a short video clip of the South Fork of Oak Creek \"Eye of the Needle\"? *Eye of the Needle Video* Limited Access: First let me state that none of this is official and is just what I understand the situation to be. If you attempt this route you are on your own. My only statement is that it concerns me when a private landowner can essentially lock up thousands of acres of public land by limiting access. So for the time being consider the information below as a historical reference only. Here is the deal.... Oak Creek requires that you cross approximately 1/3 mile of private property to access the actual slot canyon. The slot itself is on public land. The private property is owned by the Logandale Stake of the LDS church and is known as Camp Kolob. The church group that owns the property is not happy about canyoneers crossing their property, particularly when they are hosting a young women's group. I assume the problem stems from all the raping and pillaging canyoneers are noted for. In all honesty it was the problems caused by a few ignorant canyoneers that resulted in the canyon being closed. If you were to attempt the route do not try it when church groups are present at Camp Kolob, this will just create more access issues. If you do attempt this canyon please park a reasonable distance from the front gate, be ready to move the minute you park the car, move fast, quietly, and do not cause problems. If asked to leave please do so and be polite. General Information: Oak Creek is a technical canyoneering adventure that will require 7 to 9 hours to complete using the MIA Exit. The MIA Exit turns this canyon into a one day adventure with a short car or mountain bike shuttle. You will need complete technical gear along with two 50 meter ropes, several slings and a minimum of 50 feet of webbing. The longest rappel in the canyon is 150'. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/oc-sf.htm 1/25/2018 Oak Creek - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 5 Most of the drops in Oak Creek are bolted; however there are several short drops in the lower canyon that require some natural anchor and/or downclimbing skills. No additional bolts are required to descend Oak Creek. Recommended group size for Oak Creek is six or less. Oak Creek contains 10 rappels if you possess some downclimbing abilities, the number of rappels increases if your skills need work. Several rappels are multiple short drops combined into one long rappel. Always locate your next rappel anchor before pulling down your rope from above. Oak Creek is feed by a spring and has flowing water during the warm months of the year and ice during the cold months. You will be wet for several hours but very little swimming if any is required. You will encounter wading up to neck deep. Shorty wetsuits are required during hot weather. Full wetsuits or drysuits are required on cooler days. Kolob Reservoir and Cogswell Point are the USGS 7.5 minute topographical map that show Oak Creek and the MIA Exit. I also suggest carrying the Temple of Sinawava USGS 7.5 minute topographical map in case you miss the MIA Exit or decide that the exit doesn't look like a bundle of fun. Navigation for this adventure is moderate. All waypoints and maps for Oak Creek use the WGS84 datum. Always check your GPS to ensure that WGS84 is the datum before entering a waypoint into your unit. Oak Creek with the MIA Exit is rated 3C IV using the Canyon Rating System. Oak Creek has a moderate flash flood danger. Check the weather before entering this canyon. A Zion Backcountry Permit is not required for this route when using the MIA Exit because you will not actually enter the park until after you are out of the canyons and hiking the last mile to your shuttle vehicle. Guide Service: Zion Adventure Company provides a professional guide service for Oak Creek. Zion Adventure Company has established a permission agreement to guide a small number of low impact trips to Oak Creek each year. Currently this is the only option to legally visit the canyon. West Rim Trailhead: From the Zion Canyon Visitor Center drive west on Highway 9 to the town of Virgin. From Virgin turn right (north) on the signed Kolob Reservoir Road. Travel 20.5 miles to the signed Lava Point/West Rim Trailhead turn-off. Turn right (east) and follow the signs on the well-maintained gravel road for 2.3 miles to the gate blocking the road and the signed West Rim Trailhead. The trailhead has parking available for a number of vehicles. This is where you must leave your shuttle vehicle or mountain bike. Any vehicle can easily reach the trailhead in dry conditions. A very pleasant campground is available at Lava Point on a first come, first served bases. Camp Kolob Trailhead: Drive back to the Kolob Reservoir Road and turn north when you hit the pavement. Travel 1.4 miles up the paved road until it crosses Kolob Creek (21.9 miles from Virgin). 100 yards beyond the bridge over Kolob Creek there is a well used dirt road signed \"Oak Springs\" and \"Locked Gate 1/4 Mile Ahead\" (the locked gate sign is bogus). This dirt road accesses private property and cabins so please be respectful. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From the pavement follow the dirt road for 0.5 miles to a large \"V\" intersection. Take the Right Fork and follow the sign that reads \"LOGANDALE STK CAMPGROUND\" with an arrow directing traffic right. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/oc-sf.htm 1/25/2018 Oak Creek - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 5 Travel this road for 1.3 miles as it curves around the south side of a ridge with prominent views of Upper Kolob Canyon to a second \"V\" intersection. Take the Left Fork and follow the sign that reads \"LOGANDALE STK CAMPGROUND\" with an arrow directing traffic left. Follow this road for 0.3 miles to a 4-way intersection, continue straight through the intersection. From the intersection, continue an additional 0.2 miles to a second 4-way intersection. Turn right and follow the sign that reads \"LOGANDALE STK CAMPGROUND\" with an arrow directing traffic right. Follow this road for 0.3 miles until confronted with a gate and a large sign that reads \"Camp Kolob\". This is the Camp Kolob Trailhead. There is parking just to the south of the locked gate near a water tank. Again, respect private property. Trailhead parking is adjacent to a cabin. Any vehicle can easily reach the trailhead in dry conditions. There is no camping available near the trailhead. When Camp Kolob is occupied it is considered proper etiquette to ask for permission to cross the property. Please be a good neighbor so we do not lose access to this canyon. Route Information: Warning - This route is currently closed do to private property issues. So for the time being consider the information below as a historical reference only. From the Camp Kolob Trailhead (N37° 24' 27\", W113° 00' 11\") pass around the gate and hike east for 1/4 mile through a church owned campground. In the center of the campground there is a large outbuilding with beige siding with a dark green metal roof. A trail dropping down into the South Fork of Oak Creek begins 50 yards north of this building (N37° 24' 31\", W112° 59' 56\"). Begin hiking down the trail and it forks after 30 yards at a sign (N37° 24' 33\", W112° 59' 56\"), take the Right Fork and descend into the South Fork of Oak Creek past a spring. You will reach a footbridge (N37° 24' 38\", W112° 59' 59\") after hiking down a steep hill for 150 yards. This is where you enter the canyon. From the footbridge find a good spot to climb down into the canyon and begin your adventure. Because of constant water this canyon is extremely slippery. You will immediately encounter two short 10-foot rappels intermingled with some engaging downclimbing. Next up is a beautiful 50-foot rappel down a moss covered waterfall. The canyons signature obstacle is your ensuing problem. This obstacle involves rappelling 100 feet down a waterfall into a waist deep pothole where you look through a spine tingling natural bridge at the remaining 50 feet to ground level. Crawl through the \"Eye of the Needle\" and continue your rappel to the canyon floor. From below the \"Eye of the Needle\" you will be presented with three more short rappels of less than 15 feet and a couple of additional downclimbs before you exit through a deep narrow slot into the Main Fork of Oak Creek. You will likely find a nice sunny spot at this junction where you can warm your chilled bones. Next up is a one hour stroll down the Main Fork of Oak Creek to it's junction with Kolob Canyon (N37° 23' 53\", W112° 59' 33\"). This section of the route contains two short rappels, a couple of down climbs and some deep wading or a possible swim. The junction with Kolob Creek is an important landmark. It is easy to identify if you are looking for it and paying attention, but more than one group has walked past the entrance while watching their shoes. From the Kolob/Oak Creek confluence it is 250 yards down to a 12' rappel into a pool of water. There is a bolt on the left (LDC), which is easy to reach but requires swimming to exit the pool. There is a bolt on the right (LDC), which requires crossing a http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/oc-sf.htm 1/25/2018 Oak Creek - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 4 of 5 short exposed section but deposits you in waist deep water. Pick your poison. Look at your watch as you exit the pool of water. It requires 50 minutes and approximately 1 1/2 miles of steady hiking from the last rappel to the MIA Exit (N37° 22' 46\", W112° 58' 56\"). The MIA Exit is often marked with a small cairn if you are lucky. Watch for Kolob Canyon to open slightly, with a minor drainage entering from the west (right) side, this is the infamous MIA Exit Route. The exit will be the first place on your west (right) side where you would even consider it possible to exit. This exit is easy to miss so pay attention to details. Currently there are several very large logs at the MIA Exit and a deep mulchy deposit and logjam immediately after it. The MIA Exit is not a trail or marked route but a weakness, which allows access to the canyon rim. There is no correct path to follow but you will likely encounter several hiker made trails. The route is difficult with several sections of scrambling and loose rock. It will take those with good route finding skills approximately 90 minutes to reach the canyon rim and the MIA road. From the point where the MIA Drainage meets the floor of Kolob Canyon it is necessary to backtrack up canyon slightly and climb above a dryfall to the right (LUC). Once you are above the dryfall the route mostly follows the drainage bottom and bypasses dryfalls to the right and left as required. Stay in the main drainage until it begins to steepen up. At this point scramble left through a steep gambel oak forest and up to a small pass by a hoodoo. Note the drainage to your left (LUC) and below. Work your way down a sandy manzanita slope to this drainage and up to the base of an interesting little slot often referred to as the MIA Slot. From the bottom of the MIA Slot follow a drainage that veers slightly right (LUC) and extends to the canyon rim. At the top of the drainage you should intersect the MIA road (N37° 22' 49\", W112° 59' 27\"). At the MIA road begin hiking north for 1/4 mile to a split in the road (N37° 22' 59\", W112° 59' 33\"). Take the left (uphill) fork. Hike uphill for 1/4 mile to a junction (N37° 23' 05\", W112° 59' 44\") and take the road to the right. Hike for 1/2 mile with good views into Kolob Canyon to a junction (N37° 23' 09\", W112° 59' 34\") and take the road to the right. Hike for 1/2 mile to a gate and sign designating Zion Park boundary (N37° 23' 13\", W113° 00' 02\"). Continue following the road for an additional 1/4 mile to a junction (N37° 23' 05\", W113° 00' 14\") and take the road to the right. Follow the road for approximately 200 yards to a junction (N37° 23' 03\", W113° 00' 18\") and take the road to the right. The West Rim Trailhead (N37° 22' 53\", W113° 01' 24\") is 1 mile ahead on the road you are now following. What is MIA? Since I am always asked what is MIA I thought I would tell you now and save you heathens from having to ask. MIA is a Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder Day Saints (Mormon) abbreviation for \"Mutual Improvement Association\". The church owns some of the private property on the West Rim of Zion and maintains a campsite that is used by church members. I bet you are happy that you know someone who can speak a little \"Mormonese\" to help you out in this foreign land. However, some who have used the exit in the past swear that MIA stands for \"Missing In Action\". Optional Narrows Route Information: The most scenic exit route for Oak Creek is to spend two days and hike out the Zion Narrows to the Temple of Sinawava. This route can be completed in one very long day by a small group of experienced canyoneers and requires 12 to 14 hours. Completing the route in two days is traditional and allows for a more relaxing stroll or slightly larger group size. This is an excellent exit and I highly recommend using it at least once in your lifetime. If using the Narrows Exit a Zion backcountry permit must be obtained from the Zion Canyon Visitors Center. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/oc-sf.htm 1/25/2018 Oak Creek - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 5 of 5 A car shuttle is required for this route option. Your shuttle vehicle must be left at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center and than drive to the Camp Kolob trailhead to begin. Kolob Reservoir, Cogswell Point and Temple of Sinawava are the USGS 7.5 minute topographical maps needed to complete this route. Oak Creek with the Temple of Sinawava Exit is rated 3C V using the Canyon Rating System. To complete the Zion Narrows route you continue hiking down Kolob Canyon instead of climbing up the MIA Exit. The route contains one additional 15' rappel and a cold 30-foot swim. It requires approximately 3 hours to reach the Virgin River from the MIA Exit. Zion Narrows campsite #6 is located where Kolob Creek meets the Zion Narrows. Any campsite #6 through #12 is downstream and in the direction you need to go. Campsites #3, #4 and #5 are located a short distance up river at 5 minute intervals. You must register for a campsite when you pick up your backcountry permit. Any campsite #3 through #12 will meet your needs. All the sites are nice and each has something special to offer. Please be considerate and select a campsite that matches your group size. On a good day, which means clear water and low stream flow (less than 50 cfs), it will require 4 hours of hiking down the Virgin River from the Kolob confluence to reach the Temple of the Sinawava. This time estimate goes up exponentially with high and/or muddy river water.

The beauty of this canyon is unsurpassed; the narrows are extremely long, spectacular and unrelenting. Heaps Canyon offers its charm at a high price. The route is difficult and should be considered for advanced and highly skilled canyoneers only. Descent requires icy cold swimming and numerous rappels, including a breath-taking 285-foot, free air finale. Warning: Every member of your group must be a skilled canyoneer. This canyon has proven deadly to those that make a mistake. This canyon is not suitable for novice or intermediate canyoneers, even with competent leadership. The following description is not a substitute for commonsense and experience. Do not underestimate the difficulty of descending this canyon. Give the 285-foot rappel serious consideration. A rescue in this canyon would be dangerous and extremely difficult. You have been warned! Heaps Canyon is rated 4B R V using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has an extreme flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. General Information: Heaps Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure that will require a total descent time is 16 to 18 hours shuttle stop to shuttle stop if you keep moving and were smart enough to organize yourselves into a small and skilled group. We spent the night between the first and second technical section and logged 16 1/2 hours (9 hours the first day and 7 1/2 hours the second day). I would not advise attempting this route in a single day unless you have completed it before. I recommend a group size of 4 or less and breaking into pairs for the big wall finish. A small set of two-way radios would be a big help in allowing two small groups to communicate on the big wall finish, otherwise it is almost impossible to communicate on this section of the route. You will require complete technical gear, including but not limited to a 300-foot rope, (2) 50 meter ropes, ten shoulder length slings, prusik system, a pair of hooks for possible pothole escapes and several rapid links. I also suggest a spare rappel device because of the large number of floating disconnects required in this canyon. A helmet and leather gloves are a great idea, particularly on the big wall finish. Heaps Canyon requires lots of swimming through very cold water. During dry periods several potholes become difficult to exit and will require good pothole escape techniques. Full wetsuits are required in all conditions and drysuits are recommended. Summer weight wetsuits or shortie's are inadequate. Pack extremely light in a day and a half pack (2500 to 3000 cubic inches). Take a small sleeping bag, no pad, bug juice (we found a few mosquito's), water filter, snack food for 2 days, no stove, (3) one liter water bottles, dry bags and warm clothes for sleeping. A Zion backcountry permit is required to descend this canyon. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Temple of Sinawava\" are essential. Navigation for this adventure is moderate. Heaps Canyon has a high flash flood danger, check the weather http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/heaps.htm 1/25/2018 Heaps Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 5 report at the Visitor Center when you pick up your permit. All waypoints and maps for Heaps Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Always check your GPS to ensure that WGS84 is the datum before entering a waypoint into your unit. Trailhead Information: From the main Zion Canyon Visitor's Center take the Zion Canyon Shuttle to the Grotto Picnic Area located in Zion Canyon. This trailhead is also the start of the very popular Angel's Landing Trail. Route Information: From the Grotto Picnic Area (N37° 15' 33\", W112° 57' 02\"), take the paved West Rim Trail towards Angels Landing. The route snakes up Refrigerator Canyon and climbs the famous Walter's Wiggles to Scout Lookout (N37° 16' 30\", W112° 57' 01\"). The trail divides here with the south (right) fork leading to Angel's Landing and the north (left) fork leading to the West Rim. Visiting Angel's Landing will add one hour to your adventure. From Scout Lookout, continue climbing the West Rim Trail. Go past the start of the popular Behunin Canyon (N37° 16' 57\", W112° 58' 11\") and continue hiking up the switchbacks to the West Rim Trail junction (N37° 17' 12\", W112° 58' 07\") signed \"West Rim Trail\", \"Telephone Canyon\" and \"Cabin Spring\". It will require approximately 2 hours to reach Cabin Spring from the trailhead. Hike 100-yards north from the trail junction and refill your water bottles at Cabin Spring (sometimes called West Rim Spring). The spring is fairly reliable, but check with the backcountry rangers when you pick up your permit to make sure the spring is flowing. From Cabin Spring continue following the West Rim Trail for 1 1/2 miles (30 to 40 minutes). The trail will pass above Behunin Canyon with some great views. The trail will next pass the North Fork of Heaps Canyon (a popular canyoneering route often referred to as the Gunsight Entrance). Continue hiking the West Rim Trail, until you reach a point near Campsite #4 (N37° 17' 08\", W112° 59' 04\") where you can leave the trail and look down into Phantom Valley. The views from here are sensational. Look for a major ridge that extends south into Phantom Valley. This entrance is often referred to as the Phantom Valley Entrance to Heaps Canyon. As you walk out the ridge there should be a massive amphitheater on you left and Phantom Valley to your right. We found a large cairn (N37° 17' 03\", W112° 59' 09\") on the ridge just before it started to descend. Route find down the ridge until you are stopped by a cliff with a small tree (N37° 16' 54\", W112° 59' 11\") at the top. There should be slings on the tree, which is located above a dirt and gravel slope, but a better rappel can be found by hiking west 10-feet over a rock ridge and rappelling 60-feet to the ground from a large block. Continue route finding down the ridge. You will have to downclimb a short section of the ridge on the left side. Use caution at this downclimb since the rock is rotten and unstable. Just past the bottom of the downclimb there is a large pine tree (N37° 16' 51\", W112° 59' 12\") with slings, which is the second rappel. This rappel is 165-feet off the west side of the ridge (opposite the amphitheater). At the bottom of the rappel you need to downclimb a short section of gully and than route find your way back to the crest of the ridge you were originally descending. (The short downclimb of the gully can be completely avoided if using 60 meter ropes for this rappel.) Follow the ridge to the canyon floor and the beginning of Heaps Canyon (N37° 16' 00\", W112° 59' 08\"). This might be a good spot to camp. All your stuff is still dry and the spot is safe and beautiful. We found plenty of potholes containing water and a small seep in the area to fill water bottles. Continue down the canyon and you will encounter the first section of technical narrows. This section will require approximately 1 1/2 hours to navigate and has two rappels. The first rappel is 15-feet into a pothole that you must swim across and drop an additional 10-feet into a second pool. The rappel is anchored with a single bolt. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/heaps.htm 1/25/2018 Heaps Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 5 Next you will encounter a pothole that looks particularly intimidating, it appears as if you will have to hook your way out the other side. After jumping into the pothole you look around the corner and discover a small natural bridge that you can swim under and escape the pothole, really cool. The second rappel is 30-feet into a pothole and anchored with a single bolt. The canyon contains lot's of swimming, log jams, downclimbing, swimming, potholes, floating disconnects, log jams and swimming. After exiting the first section of narrows the canyon opens up. There is safe, but poor, camping spot on the left side of the canyon where a side drainage enters. The next 1/4 mile is a nice walk down a narrow sandy bottom canyon with high walls. Relax and enjoy the stroll. A sharp left turn brings you to the second set of technical narrows. This section will require approximately one hour to navigate and has three single rope rappels, all less than 30- feet in height. Lot's of swimming, logjams, downclimbing, swimming, potholes, floating disconnects, log jams and swimming. There are plenty of opportunities to practice your \"Shamu the Beached Whale\" pothole exiting technique. After exiting the second set of technical narrows you are at the \"Crossroads\" (N37° 15' 41\", W112° 58' 40\"). This is where the North Fork of Heaps (Gunsight Entrance) joins the main drainage. There is safe camping in this area. The next 1/4 mile is a \"déjà vu\" walk down a narrow sandy bottom canyon with high walls. Relax and enjoy the stroll. A sharp left turn brings you to the third and final set of technical narrows. This section will require approximately 3 hours to navigate and has 4 single rope rappels, all less than 40-feet in height. Lot's of swimming, logjams, downclimbing, swimming, potholes, floating disconnects, log jams, swimming and logjams. Kind of starting to sound familiar isn't it. The canyon opens a little and there is a large safe camping site on the ledge to the left. The canyon ends in 1/4 mile. The end of the narrows, the final two rappels and the end of the canyon come in rapid succession. A short narrows section can be bypassed by climbing a ledge to the left and rappelling 50- feet into the canyon bottom, hike down canyon a little and bypass a second short slot by climbing a ledge to the left and again, rappelling 45-feet into canyon bottom. The canyon ends several hundred yards past this rappel. The end of the canyon is identified by a skinny slit on the left side of the canyon clogged with two huge chokestones. You can look through the slit and see the valley floor hundreds of feet below. There is a large flat rock where you look through the skinny slit into the valley. This is a great place to get ready for the major obstacle that you have been thinking about since beginning this adventure. This area is where you want to remove your wet suit, dry out and sort gear. Place all needed gear where it is easy to reach since there is little room to maneuver once the next series of obstacles begin. You will need between 2 to 4 hours to complete the canyon from here so make certain you have plenty of daylight left to work with. Where the canyon disappears into the skinny slit there is a 30-foot scramble up a loose chimney to the right. Climb to the top of the chimney. The scramble up the chimney has one hard move in it. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/heaps.htm 1/25/2018 Heaps Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 4 of 5 BE CAREFUL NOT TO KNOCK ANY ROCKS LOOSE! You are directly above tourists at the Upper Emerald Pools. Falling rocks are guaranteed to get this route banned to canyoneers. At the top of the chimney there is an easy 40-foot downclimb to a small tree with slings. A belay for this easy downclimb is suggested because a minor slip will result in a major flying lesson. At the bottom of the downclimb is a small tree with slings. Rappel 55-feet from the small tree down a low angle slope to a large tree with slings. From the large tree it is a 140-foot vertical rappel to a small corner-stance often referred to as \"the bird perch\". This small corner-stance is cramped for two people, especially if you have to get anything out of your pack. I know some groups have crammed four people into the cramped corner-stance but it would be extremely tight, and movement would be restricted, so have your gear properly sorted before getting to this location. The final rappel anchor is a four bolt station. The final rappel is 285-feet, rappel down 10-feet and drop over the edge for an incredible free air experience. Collect the accolades from the admiring tourist's gathered at the Upper Emerald Pools (N37° 15' 27\", W112° 57' 59\"), perhaps even breaking a few hearts. Next, while still basking in your glory, hike down the trail to the Zion Lodge (N37° 15' 03\", W112° 57' 28\"). 285' Rappel Notes: Consider this rappel carefully. If you use a small single strand rope on the 285-foot rappel you will probably have trouble controlling your descent speed. This could have deadly consequences. One method for rappelling this section that has been used successfully, is to attach an ATC in the standard fashion using two carabiners, also attach a carabiner to the leg loop of your harness on your brake hand side. Run the rope through your ATC in the standard fashion and than through the carabiner on your leg loop using a Munter Hitch. We did this rappel with our packs clipped to our harness. Stashing a 300-foot rope at the Upper Emerald Pool is a popular option. This requires the first canyoneer down to pass the knot of two climbing ropes tied together, but relieves the party of packing a 300-foot rope through the entire canyon. A second option is to stash a 300-foot rope at the upper Emerald Pool. Rig one climbing rope hanging over the edge and a lowering system to the second climbing rope. The first canyoneer down rappels to the end of the first rope and is than lowered the remaining distance to the ground with the second rope. Practice using this system in a safe place before attempting to use it in Heaps. If you stash a rope, I suggest leaving a note with the rope explaining why it is there and a date. Something to the effect of \"If you take this rope before mm/dd/year we will die!\" should do the trick. Optional Lava Point Approach: Approaching Heaps Canyon from Lava Point using the West Rim Trail is easier but requires a long vehicle shuttle. The hiking distance is actually a little longer but there is not near the elevation change to contend with. The Lava Point Approach uses considerably less energy than hiking up from the Grotto Picnic area on the valley floor. When using the optional route you will need the USGS 7.5 minute topographical maps \"The Guardian Angels\" and \"Kolob Reservoir\" in addition to the \"Temple of Sinawava\" map used for the standard route. To reach the West Rim Trailhead you must begin at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center after dropping off your shuttle vehicle in the parking lot and drive west on Highway 9 to the town of Virgin. From Virgin turn right (north) on the signed Kolob Reservoir Road. Travel 20.5 miles to the signed Lava Point/West Rim Trailhead turn-off on the east side of the road. From the signed Lava Point/West Rim Trailhead turn-off travel east and follow the \"West Rim Trailhead\" signs on the well maintained gravel road for 2.3 miles to the gate blocking the road and the signed http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/heaps.htm 1/25/2018 Heaps Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 5 of 5 West Rim Trailhead. The trailhead has parking available for a number of vehicles. Any vehicle can easily reach the West Rim Trailhead in dry conditions. A very pleasant campground is available at Lava Point on a first come, first served bases. From the West Rim Trailhead (N37° 22' 53\", W113° 01' 23\") follow the signed West Rim Trail south. 150 yards from the trailhead the Wildcat Canyon Connector Trail joins from the west, keep hiking straight ahead. 1 mile from the trailhead a short spur path descends westward to Sawmill Springs. Proceed south on the main trail, which sticks to the top of the plateau. 5 1/4 miles from the trailhead the route drops down into a gully that leads to a grassy meadow and Potato Hollow Spring. The spring feeds an old stock tank. From the spring, the route climbs steadily south to regain the top of the plateau. From the spring it is 1 1/2 miles to a signed trail junction (N37° 18' 16\", W112° 59' 09\"). At the trail junction, the East Fork (Left Fork) follows Telephone Canyon to Cabin Spring. Take the South Fork (Right Fork), and follow the West Rim Trail 1 1/2 miles to near Campsite #4 (N37° 17' 08\", W112° 59' 04\"). This is the point where both the standard Grotto Route and optional Lava Point Approach, join and leaves the West Rim Trail. Optional Gunsight Entrance Route: The North Fork of Heaps is often referred to as the Gunsight Entrance and was the normal entrance to Heaps Canyon for a number of years until the Phantom Valley Entrance was rediscovered and popularized by Climb-Utah.com in 2001. Most canyoneers consider the Phantom Valley Entrance to be the premium route, but for those desiring a variation here is the Gunsight route. Follow the standard route to Cabin Spring on the West Rim Trail. From Cabin Spring continue following the West Rim Trail for a little over 1/2 mile (10 minutes). The trail will pass above Behunin Canyon with some great views. The trail will next reach the North Fork of Heaps Canyon (N37° 17' 01\", W112° 58' 27\") Hike out the ridge dividing North Fork of Heaps and Behunin Canyon. Bushwhack approximately 1/2 mile out the ridge and past the saddle to top of ridge crest. Look for a tree dotted arête that comes up from Heaps Canyon. Locate a huge tree with webbing and start down the arête. It should require six rappels up to 160-feet in height to reach the canyon floor. Just start rappelling and look for trees with webbing. This entrance consists of loose rock, hot sun, tree sap, scrub brush, cactus and bushwhacking. From the canyon floor hike downstream a short distance until you come to a dryfall. On the left side (LDC) of the dryfall locate a small tree and rappel 40-feet. Keep the rope out for a second rappel. Wade through a nice but short narrows section and than hike up left (LDC) to obvious drop. Next rappel is 85-feet from a tree with a sling. Hike down canyon to the \"Crossroads\" (N37° 15' 41\", W112° 58' 40\") where you will interest the Standard Phantom Valley Route. Under normal conditions wetsuits or drysuits are not required until reaching the Crossroads when using the Gunsight Entrance.

The beauty of this canyon is spectacular; the narrows are extremely long, dramatic, unrelenting and hazardous. The Sneak and Peek route described below cherry picks the best part of the canyon. Kind of like getting laid without getting married. This route is sometimes referred to as \"The Short Cut\". Imlay Canyon offers its charm at a high price. The route is difficult and should be considered for advanced and highly skilled canyoneers only. Descent requires icy cold swimming and a multitude of rappels. The biggest hazard in Imlay are the \"keeper potholes\" that require hooking to exit. The keeper potholes could prove deadly for the unskilled and unprepared. Warning: Every member of your group must be a skilled canyoneer. This canyon could be deadly for beginners, even with advanced leadership. The following description is not a substitute for commonsense and experience. Do not underestimate the difficulty of descending this canyon. Give the keeper potholes serious consideration, they can be lethal. A rescue in this canyon would be dangerous and extremely difficult. Imlay Canyon using the \"Sneak and Peek\" route is rated 4B R IV using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon has an extreme flash flood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. General Information: Imlay Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure and requires a Zion backcountry permit to descend. Total descent time is 12 to 14 hours shuttle stop to shuttle stop if you keep moving. The times noted are for a small and highly skilled group. Any difficulties or delay will result in a bivy so it is wise to plan on two days with a near perfect weather forecast. I recommend a group size of 4 or less if you plan to complete this route in one day. Imlay Canyon requires complete technical gear. The longest rappel in the canyon is 110- feet, and requires two 120-foot ropes. There are a large number of short rappels in this canyon, carrying a 60-foot rope is a great asset if you have the manpower because of the numerous short rappels. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple of double length slings, 75-feet of webbing, a pair of étriers, several rapid links, prusik system, a couple of pot shots, and a pair of bat hooks. A cheater stick (collapsible pole with a large hook on the end) can be helpful in this canyon. I also suggest a spare rappel device because of the large number of floating disconnects required in this canyon. There are approximately 20 rappels using this route. The exact number can vary because several rappels can be linked together or downclimbed. Full 5mm wetsuits or drysuits are required to complete this route. This drainage holds a large amount of water and you will be swimming and wading for several hours continuously. The route contains many short rappels and downclimbs into pools. The water is very cold. You http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/imlay.htm 1/25/2018 Imlay Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 will always encounter keeper potholes, sometimes they are extreme. Conditions change rapidly in this canyon. It is common for water levels to raise or lower several feet in one weeks time. Some of the swimming is through stagnant, debris filled water while other pools are deep and clear. Many rappel stations are unorthodox. You will likely rappel from items like pitons sticking out of a cracks, single 1/4 inch bolts, slings tied to roots and slings tied to jammed tree trunks. There are a large number of floating disconnects. Navigation for this route is moderately difficult. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Temple of Sinawava\" are essential. Any error in navigating this route could have serious consequences. There is no trail and the route requires several miles of extreme bushwhacking. All waypoints and maps for Imlay Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Trailhead Information: From the main Zion Canyon Visitor's Center take the Zion Canyon Shuttle to the Grotto Picnic Area located in Zion Canyon. This trailhead is also the start of the very popular Angel's Landing Trail. Route Information: From the Grotto Picnic Area (N37° 15' 34\", W112° 57' 02\"), take the paved West Rim Trail towards Angels Landing. The route snakes up Refrigerator Canyon and climbs the famous Walter's Wiggles to Scout Lookout (N37° 16' 30\", W112° 57' 01\"). The trail divides here with the right fork leading to Angel's Landing (N37° 16' 09\", W112° 56' 52\") and the left fork leading to the West Rim. Visiting Angel's Landing will add 1 hour to your adventure. From Scout Lookout, continue climbing the West Rim Trail. 1 1/4 miles past Scout Lookout, the West Rim Trail descends and crosses a canyon using a small bridge. This is where the bushwhacking begins. Cross the bridge and continue along the West Rim Trail for 100 yards. Stop (N37° 17' 12\", W112° 57' 24\") and look directly north. You should see two canyons divided by a ridge or cleaver. Your first objective is to climb to the saddle of the canyon on the right (east) side of the ridge. The bushwhacking is easier if you follow the ridgeline between the two canyons until forced to drop to the bottom of the east side canyon. Upon reaching the first saddle (N37° 18' 11\", W112° 57' 31\") descend the backside to the bottom of a small bowl (N37° 18' 17\", W112° 57' 31\"). From the bottom of the small bowl you must again climb a saddle located to the north. Continue up the canyon bottom to the second saddle (N37° 18' 25\", W112° 57' 32\"). You will encounter a short section of fourth class climbing about midway to the saddle. From the top of the saddle you should have a good view into Imlay Canyon. Descend the canyon on the backside of the saddle to the bottom of Imlay. As you near the junction of the tributary that you are following and Imlay, you will encounter some obstacles in the tributary canyon. At the obstacles exit onto the slickrock to your right (east) side. Hike down the slickrock and route find your way to the bottom of Imlay. This junction in Imlay is often referred to as \"The Crossroads\" (N37° 18' 56\", W112° 57' 43\"). The Crossroads are a popular and safe spot to camp when using two days to complete Imlay. Most parties will require 4 to 5 hours to reach The Crossroads. This is where the bushwhacking ends and the real fun begins. Time to suit up and break out the technical gear. Head downstream through several simple narrows. You will soon enter the section of canyon refereed to as the \"Extreme Narrows\". This section will require approximately 3 hours to navigate so check the weather before committing. The technical portion begins easy enough with a short downclimb and a swim. Continue down canyon and into the bowels of the earth. The Extreme Narrows contain lot's of swimming, logjams, downclimbing, swimming, potholes, floating disconnects, logjams and swimming. There are several opportunities to practice your \"Shamu the Beached Whale\" pothole exiting technique. There are two potholes in this section that can be extremely difficult to exit and are referred to as \"keeper potholes\". http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/imlay.htm 1/25/2018 Imlay Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 The Extreme Narrows are remarkably beautiful but hard to photograph since you are in darkness. It is fun to look straight up and see the slot canyon twisting hundreds of feet over your head. At one spectacular location you will reach an arch located in the watercourse. Use the arch as an anchor and set up a simultaneous rappel into the plunge pool at the bottom. After exiting the Extreme Narrows there is a short section where you can escape the canyon bottom and bivy if required, there is no good camping at this location but it does provide a safe place to hang out if weather is threatening or night approaching. The second and final section of narrows are often refereed to as the \"Exit Narrows\" and will require approximately 2 hours to negotiate. The Exit Narrows contain lot's of swimming, potholes, logjams, downclimbing, swimming, potholes, floating disconnects, potholes and swimming. The Exit Narrows contain at least two keeper potholes. The last pothole being the deepest and most difficult you will encounter. There is a bypass of the last keeper pothole to the right and up, but that would not be as much fun. The Exit Narrows empty onto a large platform overhanging the Zion Narrows (N37° 18' 35\", W112° 56' 57\"). This is the longest and last rappel you will encounter. It is a 110-foot rappel into the Virgin River. From here it is a simple 2 1/2 mile stroll down the Virgin River to the Temple of the Sinawava (N37° 17' 07\", W112° 56' 52\"). Keeper Pothole Notes: You will have to escape several keeper potholes in Imlay Canyon. Having a strong, technically skilled climber in your party is a big asset. Hooking might be required. This involves using bat hooks in small drilled holes to climb up the sandstone wall. Drilling new holes is to be used as a last resort. Several other methods for escaping keeper potholes include, but are not limited to, lassoing an object on the far side, partner assists, throw bags, pack toss and cheater sticks. If you are not skilled and proficient in all of these skills you do not belong in Imlay Canyon. Related Link: German Tourists - Where did you come from?

Most novice hikers can easily visit the bottom portion of canyon. A minor touch of climbing or athletic skill is required to visit the entire canyon. Kanarra Creek is an extremely radiant and photogenic slot canyon located just outside the Kolob Section of Zion National Park. The canyon offers an abundance of opportunities for the shutterbug to get that perfect slot canyon photograph. General Information: Kanarra Creek is a semi-technical canyoneering adventure. This canyon is remarkably photogenic. It is possible for novice hikers and families to visit the lower section of slot canyon. Those who want to visit the entire canyon and upper slot will need at least one experienced hiker or rock climber along to help defeat a few minor obstacles. This route will require 4 hours to complete. You will need a 30-foot rope for hand lines, belays, lowering packs and possible emergency use. I also suggest carrying a 30-foot length of webbing to replace the fixed handlines if necessary. Kanarra Creek is the water supply for the town of Kanarraville. Please pick up all trash, avoid all water pipes and keep the water clean or we will lose this route to hiking. This canyon is not accessible during spring run-off when water levels are high. Kanarra Creek requires several miles of knee deep wading combined with a couple of sections of possible waist deep wading. The water is cold and a hot day is suggested. \"Kanarraville\" is the USGS 7.5 minute topographical map that shows Kanarra Creek. Navigation for this adventure is easy, but there is no established trail. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. You will be walking and wading in a canyon bottom. Kanarra Creek is rated 2C II using the Canyon Rating System. You do not need a Zion backcountry permit for this canyon because it is located outside the National Park. Kanarra Creek has a moderate flash flood danger. Check the weather report before entering the slot canyon. Trailhead Information: The Kanarra Creek Trailhead is accessible to all vehicles in all weather conditions. The road to the trailhead is paved. A car shuttle is not required for this adventure. The trailhead consists of a large signed parking area with toilets, information kiosk and picnic tables. There is a $10.00 fee (as of 2016) required for using the parking area. For those to cheap to pay you can park at the Town Hall three blocks away on 40 South Main Street for free. Vehicles parked elsewhere or not paying are booted or towed, you have been warned. From the North: From I-15 near Kanarraville Utah, take Exit #51, signed Kanarraville. Follow the highway south towards Kanarraville for 4.7 miles to the center of town. From the intersection of Main Street and 100 North, turn east (left) on 100 North and follow it for 0.3 miles until the road turns http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/kanarra.htm 1/25/2018 Kanarra Creek - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 to dirt and is blocked by a gate. The signed Kanarra Creek Trailhead is located near the gate on the north (left) side of the road. From the South: From I-15 near Kanarraville Utah, take Exit #42, signed Kanarraville & New Harmony. Follow the highway north towards Kanarraville for 4.5 miles to the center of town. From the intersection of Main Street and 100 North, turn east (right) on 100 North and follow it for 0.3 miles until the road turns to dirt and is blocked by a gate. The signed Kanarra Creek Trailhead is located near the gate on the north (left) side of the road. Route Information: From the Kanarra Creek Trailhead (N37° 32' 15\", W113° 10' 33\"), pass through the gate and follow the dirt maintenance road up the hill for 1/4 mile to a large water tank (N37° 32' 19\", W113° 10' 24\"). Keep following the maintenance road as it descends for 1/4 mile to a stream crossing. After crossing the stream just keep following the dirt road to a second crossing. After the second crossing the maintenance road climbs to a fenced enclosure and ends (N37° 32' 17\", W113° 09' 32\"). From the fenced enclosure follow the hiking trail heading east. There are an abundance of different trails in the lower canyon but all roads lead to Rome. It's nearly impossible to get lost since the creek flows out of the slot canyon that is your destination. Just follow the trail that works best for you. All the trails converge in the upper canyon the route becomes easier. Approximately 1 1/2 miles from the trailhead you will encounter the first section of slot canyon (N37° 32' 17\", W113° 09' 11\"). It is rather impressive as the creek appears to burst from the massive sandstone wall. Follow the creek and wade up through the first section of narrows. The head of the narrows is guarded by a massive 15-foot chokestone that you must climb up and over. This is normally the most difficult obstacle in the canyon. There is a knotted rope running between two bolts on the south (right) canyon wall to help you defeat this obstacle. Care should be used by the first person up to insure that the rope is in good condition. If not, please consider replacing it and packing out the trashed rope. Above the massive chokestone the slot opens briefly with a couple interesting sandstone pools, the upper most pool contains a fun waterslide that drops you into the middle of the pool. Take a slide and have some fun. The canyon remains extremely impressive as it slots up again above the waterslide and pool. Just keep wading up stream and you will reach the second major obstacle in the canyon. This is a 10-foot rock jam that you must again climb up and over. There is a rope running between two bolts on the south (right) canyon wall to help you defeat this obstacle. Care should be used by the first person up to insure that the rope is in good condition. If not, please consider replacing it and packing out the trashed rope. Once above the second major obstacle you can hike up canyon as far as you desire. It is not long before all signs of a trail disappear and you will be constantly hiking up the creek bottom. It is an enjoyable stroll with changing scenery around every corner. Hike up canyon as far as you desire and than return the way you came. No Dogs Allowed: PLEASE!!! do not take your dog. This drainage is Kanarraville's drinking water. If the water quality drops below the health department standard the canyon will be closed to all visitors. The no dog rule is not because the town hates dogs, its to protect the water supply.

Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Kolob Canyon With both the MIA and Narrows Exit Zion National Park Technical Canyoneering Kolob Canyon is a unique and picturesque technical slot canyon, which gained a lethal reputation in 1993 after a local scout troop was trapped in the canyon and two of their leaders were killed. This reputation has raised Kolob to mystic proportions in the canyoneering community and placed a black mark on the canyon where the National Park Service concerned. It has now been many years since the Kolob Canyon Disaster but the canyon is still strewn with the scout troops technical, personal and camping gear. Please use caution in this canyon and use the scout troops unfortunate experience to your benefit. Kolob Canyon is a radiant and exciting slot canyon and certainly worth the effort to visit. As with all technical canyons it must be respected. General Information: Kolob Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure that will require 8 to 10 hours to complete using the MIA Exit. The MIA Exit turns this canyon into a loop adventure and a car shuttle is not required. You will need complete technical gear along with two 60 meter ropes, several slings and a minimum of 50 feet of webbing. Kolob Canyon requires lots of swimming through very cold water. Full wetsuits are required and drysuits are recommended. Summer weight wetsuits or shortie's are inadequate. Kolob Canyon has been heavily bolted but has recently been completed using only natural anchors. No additional bolts are required to descend Kolob Canyon. Out of courtesy for others and respect for the canyon please limit group size to six or less. Kolob Canyon contains 11 rappels if you possess good downclimbing abilities, the number increases if you could use some improvement on your downclimbing skills. The longest rappel is 170 feet. Several rappels are multiple short drops combined into one long rappel. Locate your next rappel point before pulling down your rope from above. Kolob Canyon is unique in that an irrigation dam above the canyon controls the stream flow into Kolob Canyon. Washington County Water Conservancy District controls the release of water that flows through Kolob Creek and into the Virgin River. They release a dribble of water most of the summer, when the canyon would otherwise be dry. The potholes and plunge pools are always full of clean, clear and very cold water. If you intend to canyoneer Kolob Canyon you must check the water flow and obtain a Zion backcountry permit. The Washington County Water Conservancy District controls Kolob Creek. Any flow above 3cfs is dangerous. Zion National Park will not issue a backcountry permit when flow is above 5cfs. You can call 435-673-3617 beforehand to verify the release schedule. If you reach the stream and more than a trickle of water is flowing turn around immediately. Kolob Canyon is deadly with high stream flows. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/kolob.htm 1/25/2018 Kolob Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 4 Kolob Reservoir and Cogswell Point are the USGS 7.5 minute topographical map that show Kolob Canyon and the MIA Exit. I also suggest carrying the Temple of Sinawava USGS 7.5 minute topographical map in case you miss the MIA Exit or decide that the exit doesn't look like a bundle of fun. Navigation for this adventure is moderate. Kolob Canyon with the MIA Exit is rated 3B R IV using the Canyon Rating System. Kolob Canyon has a moderate flash flood danger because of the already mentioned dam above the slot, check the weather report at the Visitor Center when you pick up your permit. All waypoints and maps for Kolob Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Always check your GPS to ensure that WGS84 is the datum before entering a waypoint into your unit. Trailhead Information: After picking up your backcountry permit at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center drive west on Highway 9 to the town of Virgin. From Virgin turn right (north) on the signed Kolob Reservoir Road. Travel 20.5 miles to the signed Lava Point/West Rim Trailhead turn-off on the east side of the road. At this turn-off many consider it safe practice to continue driving up the Kolob Reservoir Road an addition 1.4 miles to the point where Kolob Creek crosses under the road. This allows you to visually check stream flow conditions to see that they match what was quoted by the Washington County Water Conservancy District. Do not trust in blind faith that what you were quoted is gospel. From the signed Lava Point/West Rim Trailhead turn-off travel east and follow the \"West Rim Trailhead\" signs on the well maintained gravel road for 2.3 miles to the gate blocking the road and the signed West Rim Trailhead. The trailhead has parking available for a number of vehicles. Any vehicle can easily reach the trailhead in dry conditions. A very pleasant campground is available at Lava Point on a first come, first served bases. Route Information: From the West Rim Trailhead (N37° 22' 53\", W113° 01' 23\") begin hiking north back up the road you just drove down. After hiking 300 yards the road makes a shape west (left) turn with a large grassy area to the east (N37° 23' 03\", W113° 01' 26\"). Hike east across the open grassy area and you will locate an old logging road. Begin hiking down the logging road and take the north (left) fork where it splits just past the open grassy area. Follow the logging road north as it crosses the head of Boundary Canyon. Follow the logging road above the spring at the top of the Boundary drainage and up to a pass and over the other side into the Kolob Canyon drainage. From the grassy meadow you must follow the logging road for approximately 1 1/4 miles or about 25 minutes. At this point (N37° 23' 34\", W113° 01' 35\") it is time to leave the logging road and bushwhack, a very short distance, downhill to the bottom of the Kolob Drainage (N37° 23' 37\", W113° 01' 32\"). It is not really important that you find the perfect spot to leave the logging road since everything downhill at this point leads to Kolob Canyon. The bushwhacking is just a little easier if you can locate one of several faint hiker made trails. From the bottom of Kolob Canyon hike downstream for 1/4 mile to the first rappel (N37° 23' 40\", W113° 01' 20\"). As you are hiking towards the first rappel you will notice a hiker made trail on the north side of the stream, which will eliminate most the bushwhacking. From the first rappel visually check stream flow conditions to see that they match what you were quoted by the Washington County Water Conservancy District. The next 1/2 mile is the meat of the sandwich and very slow going as you negotiate numerous rappels and swims that approach in rapid-fire succession. The longest rappel you will encounter is 160 feet in height. After several hours the canyon will open up slightly and http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/kolob.htm 1/25/2018 Kolob Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 4 allow you to begin briskly hiking down canyon. Just after the canyon opens up you will encounter an astounding 400' waterfall (N37° 23' 54\", W113° 00' 52\") on the north side of the canyon. From the waterfall it is 1 1/2 miles or approximately 45 minutes down to the junction with Oak Creek (N37° 23' 53\", W112° 59' 33\"). This section of the route contains several short downclimbing problems and a couple of short swims. The junction with Oak Creek is an important landmark. It is easy to identify if you are looking for it and paying attention, but more than one group has walked past the entrance while watching their shoes. From the Kolob/Oak Creek confluence it is 250 yards down to a 12' rappel into a pool of water. There is a bolt on the east (left), which is easy to reach but requires swimming to exit the pool. There is a bolt on the west (right), which requires crossing a short exposed section but deposits you in waist deep water. Pick your poison. Look at your watch as you exit the pool of water. It requires 50 minutes and approximately 1 1/2 miles of steady hiking from the last rappel to the MIA Exit (N37° 22' 46\", W112° 58' 56\"). The MIA Exit is often marked with a small cairn if you are lucky. Watch for Kolob Canyon to open slightly, with a minor drainage entering from the west (right) side, this is the infamous MIA Exit Route. The exit will be the first place on your west (right) side where you would even consider it possible to exit. This exit is easy to miss so pay attention to details. Currently there are several very large logs at the MIA Exit and a deep mulchy deposit and logjam immediately after it. The MIA Exit is not a trail or marked route but a weakness, which allows access to the canyon rim. There is no correct path to follow but you will likely encounter several hiker made trails. The route is difficult with several sections of scrambling and loose rock. It will take those with good route finding skills approximately 90 minutes to reach the canyon rim and the MIA road. From the point where the MIA Drainage meets the floor of Kolob Canyon it is necessary to backtrack up canyon slightly and climb above a dryfall to the right (LUC). Once you are above the dryfall the route mostly follows the drainage bottom and bypasses dryfalls to the right and left as required. Stay in the main drainage until it begins to steepen up. At this point scramble left through a steep gambel oak forest and up to a small pass by a hoodoo. Note the drainage to your left (LUC) and below. Work your way down a sandy manzanita slope to this drainage and up to the base of an interesting little slot often referred to as the MIA Slot. From the bottom of the MIA Slot follow a drainage that veers slightly right (LUC) and extends to the canyon rim. At the top of the drainage you should intersect the MIA road (N37° 22' 49\", W112° 59' 27\"). At the MIA road begin hiking north for 1/4 mile to a split in the road (N37° 22' 59\", W112° 59' 33\"). Take the left (uphill) fork. Hike uphill for 1/4 mile to a junction (N37° 23' 05\", W112° 59' 44\") and take the road to the right. Hike for 1/2 mile with good views into Kolob Canyon to a junction (N37° 23' 09\", W112° 59' 34\") and take the road to the right. Hike for 1/2 mile to a gate and sign designating Zion Park boundary (N37° 23' 13\", W113° 00' 02\"). Continue following the road for an additional 1/4 mile to a junction (N37° 23' 05\", W113° 00' 14\") and take the road to the right. Follow the road for approximately 200 yards to a junction (N37° 23' 03\", W113° 00' 18\") and take the road to the right. The West Rim Trailhead is 1 mile ahead on the road you are now following. What is MIA? Since I am always asked what is MIA I thought I would tell you now and save you heathens from having to ask. MIA is a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormon) http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/kolob.htm 1/25/2018 Kolob Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 4 of 4 abbreviation for \"Mutual Improvement Association\". The church owns some of the private property on the West Rim of Zion and maintains a campsite that is used by church members. I bet you are happy that you know someone who can speak a little \"Mormonese\" to help you out in this foreign land. However, some that have used the exit in the past swear that MIA stands for \"Missing In Action\". Optional Narrows Route Information: The historical route for Kolob Canyon is to spend two days and hike out the Zion Narrows to the Temple of Sinawava. This route can be completed in one very long day by a small group of experienced canyoneers and requires 12 to 15 hours. Completing the route in two days is traditional and allows for a more relaxing stroll or slightly larger group size. This is an excellent exit and I highly recommend using it at least once in your lifetime. A shuttle vehicle is also required to complete this route. Kolob Reservoir, Cogswell Point and Temple of Sinawava are the USGS 7.5 minute topographical maps needed to complete this route. Kolob Canyon with the Temple of Sinawava Exit is rated 3B R V using the Canyon Rating System. To complete the Temple of Sinawava route you continue hiking down canyon for 11 miles instead of climbing up the MIA Exit. The route contains one additional 15' rappel and a cold 30-foot swim. It requires approximately 3 hours to reach the Virgin River from the MIA Exit. Zion Narrows campsite #6 is located where Kolob Creek meets the Zion Narrows (N37° 20' 57\", W112° 57' 03\"). Any campsite #6 through #12 is downstream and in the direction you need to go. Campsites #2, #3, #4 and #5 are located a short distance up river at 5 minute intervals. You must register for a campsite when you pick up your backcountry permit. Any campsite #2 through #12 will meet your needs. All the sites are nice and each has something special to offer. Please be considerate and select a campsite that matches your group size. On a good day, which means clear water and low stream flow (less than 50 cfs), it will require 4 hours of hiking down the Virgin River from the Kolob confluence to reach the Temple of the Sinawava (N37° 17' 07\", W112° 56' 52\"). This time estimate goes up exponentially with high and/or muddy river water. Video: This short canyoneering video of Kolob Canyon was taken in September of 2011 and is compliments of Nick Como.

There are several popular routes into the canyon to stop you from getting bored. All routes circle around behind Checkerboard Mesa and descend Misery Canyon to Parunuweap Canyon (East Fork of the Virgin River). All routes contain outstanding scenery. There are several spectacular sections of narrows and slots. The canyon is enjoyable with several short rappels, scrambling, downclimbing and plenty of swimming and wading. General Information: Misery Canyon has two popular route options known as the West Fork and East Fork. The West Fork is the more popular of the two options and is usually the route referred to as \"Fat Man's Misery\". The West Fork does not require a vehicle shuttle while the East Fork does. Both the West and the East Forks are similar in time and equipment required. Both canyoneering adventures require complete technical gear. The exit route has a southern exposure and is very hot and in direct sunlight during the afternoon hours. Both routes will require 8 to 9 hours to complete depending on your speed and how much time you spend exploring Parunuweap Canyon. You will need a 100' rope. I recommend carrying several slings, 50 feet of webbing and several rappel rings. Almost all rappels use natural anchors, the few bolts that exist are antique and are not required. Leave the bolt kit at home. This canyon has been done for years without additional bolts and I would hate to see every minor drop bolted like most Zion canyons. Consider modest downclimbing skills a requirement for completing this canyon. The canyon has plenty of water. There are several swims and waist deep sections of wading. A wetsuit is required during cool weather. On hot days leave the wetsuit in the car, the water in this canyon never seems to be really cold, which is a departure from normal for Zion. The miserable part about this canyon is the hike out in the full sun at the finish. I have found that timing your hike out to correspond with the evening hours makes the hike much more enjoyable. Note what time it gets dark and begin your hike out three hours earlier. Don't forget to pack a headlamp if you are using this method just to be on the safe side. You will find plenty to explore and nice places to lounge around in Parunuweap as you wait for the cool evening hike. Navigation for this adventure is difficult, and requires several miles of travel over open terrain. A GPS is very useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Springdale East\" and \"The Barracks\" are required. All waypoints and maps for Misery Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Always check your GPS to ensure that WGS84 is the datum before entering a waypoint into your unit. Parunuweap streamflow. of less then 60 cfs should make the route easy. Streamflow great then 100 cfs might make hiking upstream in Parunuweap extremely difficult. Visit USGS Streamflow - East Fork Virgin River for current conditions. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/misery.htm 1/25/2018 Misery Canyon (Fat Man's Misery) - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 5 A Zion Backcountry Permit is not required since the technical section of Misery Canyon is located outside the National Park Boundary. However, the Park will issue you a permit if you ask for one. The Park feels that this offers you a degree of safety and provides them with the knowledge of who is using the canyon. Both Forks of Misery Canyon are rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. Misery Canyon has a moderate flashflood danger, check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Checkerboard Mesa Trailhead: From the East Entrance to Zion National Park, take Highway 9 into the park for 0.7 miles. Just past the parking area for Checkerboard Mesa there are several small turn-outs that you can park at. Your route is up the obvious canyon west of Checkerboard Mesa. East Fork Trailhead: Completing the East Fork of Misery Canyon requires a vehicle shuttle. The trailhead is accessible to high clearance vehicles during good weather. After dropping a shuttle vehicle at the Checkerboard Mesa Trailhead you must than head to the East Fork Trailhead. From the East Entrance of Zion National Park, drive east 3.5 miles on highway 9 to mile marker 47.2. Turn south on a well-maintained dirt road. Follow the dirt road south for 0.3 miles to a fork in the road. The left (east) fork leads to Poverty Trail, take the right (west) fork and follow the dirt road 3.2 miles to its termination high on the White Cliffs. West Fork of Misery Canyon: From the Checkerboard Mesa Trailhead (N37° 13' 35\", W112° 53' 04\") climb the canyon west of Checkerboard Mesa, which splits the White Cliffs. This is an interesting canyon, often referred to as Checkerboard Canyon, which is shaded in the morning and evening. There are several small obstacles in the canyon that can be bypassed to the east (left) on hiker made trails. When you reach the saddle of Checkerboard Canyon (N37° 12' 42\", W112° 53' 00\") descend the gully on the backside. There is a trail on the west (right) side of the gully that bypasses the rough and difficult gully bottom. You are now in drainage #1 (N37° 12' 31\", W112° 52' 56\"). When the gully flattens out take one of the many trails that lead east around a large sandstone buttress, and crosses drainage #2 (N37° 12' 22\", W112° 52' 29\"). Keep following any of several trails and cross drainage #3 (N37° 12' 15\", W112° 52' 07\"). Hike over the sandstone domes and into Drainage #4, which is the West Fork of Misery Canyon and our intended destination. Find a reasonable place to descend to the bottom of drainage #4, Misery Canyon (N37° 12' 13\", W112° 51' 47\"). The canyon is fun and interesting from this point on, just head downstream. The upper narrows appear and disappear as you hike down canyon. You will encounter wading, downclimbing, four short rappels, a few slides and lots of narrow slots. There are no serious obstacles if you look around and are prepared. Many of the rappels can be downclimbed by the skilled. At one point you will reach a short rappel with no noticeable anchor, but if you were paying attention you can use the natural bridge conveniently located just up canyon. Some more short sections of narrows and anther natural bridge, followed by anther section of short narrows will soon deliver you to the Confluence of the East and West Fork of Misery Canyon. East Fork of Misery Canyon: From the East Fork Trailhead (N37° 13' 31\", W112° 51' 20\") hike down the gully to the west. Getting down from the rim of the White Cliffs you must scramble down through a nasty scree field. Once you reach the bottom of the canyon just head downstream. The upper narrows http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/misery.htm 1/25/2018 Misery Canyon (Fat Man's Misery) - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 5 appear and disappear as you hike down canyon. You will encounter wading, downclimbing, three short rappels, a few slides and lots of narrow slots. There are no serious obstacles if you look around and are prepared. The first dryfall can be avoided by climbing up the canyon and circling around to the east on slickrock. If you decide to rappel this dryfall instead of skipping it you need a 50-meter rope because the rappel anchor is located slightly up canyon from the dryfall. This is considered the first rappel even though it can be avoided. Just keep following the drainage down to its confluence with the West Fork. You will know you are getting close because the two drainage's join shortly after the third rappel that is 20 feet. Misery Confluence: From the confluence of the West and East Fork of Misery Canyon (N37° 11' 18\", W112° 51' 27\") the drainage's personality changes drastically. The walls rise high on both sides as the canyon narrows up one last time. The next obstacle is a 35-foot rappel down the face of a rockslide. Use caution in this area, there are many loose and falling rocks. From the rappel just follow the drainage down canyon. You will encounter several slides and scrambles. The finish of Misery Canyon is one of the most beautiful endings around. You will climb through a very dark narrow section with natural bridges, deep pools and a flowing sulfur spring. Several short swims bring you to the confluence with Parunuweap Canyon (N37° 10' 59\", W112° 51' 38\"). Parunuweap is a spectacular canyon with a flowing river. The river is usually clear except after heavy rains or during spring runoff. There is a small spring between Misery and where you hike out of Parunuweap on the south side of the canyon, but I don't know if it is reliable. I prefer to fill up out of the spring over the river if given a choice because of the cattle and pesticides used upstream. I recommend you treat any water you drink. Explore Parunuweap as you desire, the area is a seldom-visited paradise. The area up stream from Misery Canyon is known as \"The Barracks\". Parunuweap is closed at the Zion Park Boundary, which is approximately 1/2 mile downstream from the mouth of Misery Canyon. Many canyoneers slink downstream past this invisible barrier and visit Labyrinth Falls, which is approximately 3/4 miles below the mouth of Misery Canyon. The section of canyon between Misery and Labyrinth Falls is some of the deepest and most spectacular narrows in Parunuweap and easily rival those found in it's big brother The Zion Narrows. The Exit: From the confluence of Misery and Parunuweap canyons head downstream for 1/4 mile to a large horseshoe bend. The exit (N37° 10' 52\", W112° 51' 46\") is out the inside of the horseshoe bend heading north. Look for one of several trails that lead through the bushy area. There is a plaque commemorating the 1872 Powell Expedition where the bushy area meets the rock cliff on the downstream side of the horseshoe bend. The plaque is hidden behind some thick bushes on the north wall. You will discover that the hike from Parunuweap back to the trailhead will require about 3 hours and is long, hot, sandy, in the sun and uphill. You will require a minimum of 3 liters of water, per person for the hike out on a hot day. The hike out is best described as \"Misery\". The exit gully from Parunuweap is 3rd class scrambling for the first 1/4 mile. Climb to the top of the steep gully and follow the ridge on your west (left) side. This ridge is what defines drainage #3 and drainage #4 above on the West Fork Route. You will probably discover cairns and hiker made trails that appear and disappear that will help you stay on route. You will eventually cross the hiker made trail (N37° 12' 15\", W112° 52' 07\") that is used to access the West Fork of Misery Canyon. Turn west on the hiker made trail and follow it to a large sandstone buttress (N37° 12' 31\", W112° 52' 56\"), which marks the east side of http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/misery.htm 1/25/2018 Misery Canyon (Fat Man's Misery) - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 4 of 5 Checkerboard Canyon, turn right and head up to the Checkerboard Canyon Saddle (N37° 12' 42\", W112° 53' 00\"). As you climb to Checkerboard Saddle it helps to remember that there is a trail on the west side of the gully approximately 100-feet above the canyon bottom that is much easier than bushwhacking and scrambling up the bottom of the gully. From the saddle in Checkerboard Canyon it is all downhill to Highway 9 and the Checkerboard Mesa Trailhead (N37° 13' 35\", W112° 53' 04\"). Optional Local Route: Many of the area locals use a different route for exploring Misery and Parunuweap Canyon. The optional route requires the set up of a 3 hour 4x4 shuttle, but the route visits the best part of Parunuweap canyon. To use the local route you descend Misery to Parunuweap. Then you hike up Parunuweap and exit out a little side slot canyon known as French Canyon. French Canyon is the same exit canyon used for those doing the Rock Canyon route. The total time requirement is about the same but the hike out of Parunuweap to the Rock Canyon Trailhead is relatively short and easy. Most of the extra time is spent hiking through the beautiful Barracks section. If the East Fork of the Virgin is flowing about 60 cfs the hike up Parunuweap would be difficult. Hiking Notes: If you wish to visit Parunuweap Canyon and the bottom section of Misery Canyon without using technical gear it is possible to use the exit route described in the Misery Canyon description to both enter and exit Parunuweap Canyon. It is also possible to complete a two or three day backpack adventure through Parunuweap Canyon. Powell Plaque Inscription Reads: \"Major John Wesley Powell 1834-1902 explorer, scientist, Steven V. Jones 1840-1920 teacher, topographer, Joseph W. Young 1829-1873 Mormon pioneer leader, Descended Labyrinth Falls 1/2 mile below Monday, September 30, 1872 during first Parunuweap Canyon traverse. Powell named this canyon from the Paiute Indian word 'Parunuweap' which means roaring water canyon. Dedicated September 30, 1972.\" History: John Wesley Powell first visited and documented Parunuweap in September 1870 during early exploration. Powell named the canyon \"Parunuweap\", a Paiute term that translates as \"Roaring Water Canyon\". The following excerpts are from Powell's journal. September 10 -- The Indian name of the canyon is Paru'nuweap, or Roaring Water Canyon. Between the little river and the foot of the walls is a dense growth of willows, vines, and wild rosebushes, and with great difficulty we make our way through this tangled mass. It is not a wide stream-- only 20 or 30 feet across in most places; shallow, but very swift. After spending some hours in breaking our way through the mass of vegetation and climbing rocks here and there, it is determined to wade along the stream. In some places this is an easy task, but here and there we come to deep holes where we have to wade to our armpits. Soon we come to places so narrow that the river fills the channel and we wade perforce. In many places the bottom is a quicksand, into which we sink, and it is with great difficulty that we make progress. In some places the holes are so deep that we have to swim, and our little bundles of blankets and rations are fixed to a raft made of driftwood and pushed before us. Now and then there is a little flood- plain, on which we can walk, and we cross and recross the stream and wade along the channel where the water is so swift as almost to carry us off our feet and were are in danger every moment of being swept down, until night comes on. Finding a little patch of flood-plain, on which there is a huge pile of driftwood and a clump of box-elders, and near by a mammoth stream bursting from the rocks, we soon have a huge fire. Our clothes are spread to dry; we make a cup of coffee, take out our bread and cheese and dried beef, and enjoy a hearty supper. We estimate that we have traveled eight miles to-day. The canyon here is about 1,200 feet deep. It has been very narrow and winding all the way down to this point. September 11 -- Wading again this morning; sinking in the quicksand, swimming the deep http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/misery.htm 1/25/2018 Misery Canyon (Fat Man's Misery) - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 5 of 5 waters, and making slow and painful progress where the waters are swift and the bed of the stream rocky. The canyon is steadily becoming deeper and in many places very narrow-- only 20 or 30 feet wide below, and in some places no wider, and even narrower, for hundreds of feet overhead. There are places where the river in sweeping by curves has cut far under the rocks, but still preserves its narrow channel, so that there is an overhanging wall on one side and an inclined wall on the other. In places a few hundred feet above, it becomes vertical again, and thus the view to the sky is entirely closed. Everywhere this deep passage is dark and gloomy and resounds with the noise of rapid waters. At noon we are in a canyon 2,500 feet deep, and we come to a fall where the walls are broken down and huge rocks beset the channel, on which we obtain a foothold to reach a level 200 feet below. Here the canyon is again wider, and we find a flood-plain along which we can walk, now on this, now on that side of the stream. Gradually the canyon widens; steep rapids, cascades, and cataracts are found along the river, but we wade only where it is necessary to cross. We make progress with very great labor, having to climb over piles of broken rocks.

] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Parunuweap Canyon AKA: The Barracks Zion National Park Canyoneering & Backpacking Take the famous Zion Narrows, remove the training wheels, and you have a good impression of Parunuweap Canyon. This canyon is just as spectacular as it's big brother, but is more remote, seldom visited, contains a poorly marked route and is more difficult. This route follows the East Fork of the Virgin River into Parunuweap Canyon, also known as \"The Barracks\". This is one of the more dramatic and foreign canyons in southern Utah. The route contains no technical barriers and can be completed by experienced hikers and backpackers. Good navigation skills are a prerequisite for this route. General Information: Parunuweap Canyon is a canyoneering adventure that will require 10 to 14 hours to complete for experienced hikers. The less experienced, high water (above 50 cfs) or muddy water conditions will require additional time. The total route is 18 1/2 miles long, which does not include side canyon exploration. This route is commonly done as a two or three day backpack, which allows more time to explore and admire the scenery. A car shuttle is required for this adventure. You will need a hiking staff or trekking poles to provide sure footing during the miles of river hiking. An old pair of ski poles also work great. You will want to pack everything that is to stay dry into drybags. Visit the gear suggestions page for the proper footwear and clothing, this is not a technical canyon so many of the items in the gear section are not required but are still worth reading about to gather ideas for enjoyable wet canyoneering. A 50-foot rope is suggested for lowering packs and emergency use. Parunuweap Canyon requires many miles of wading with depths up to chest deep combined with a couple of possible short swims. If required, the swimming is never further than 15 to 20 feet. The water is cold and a hot day is suggested. Everyone will want to carry a warm, dry fleece to put on if they become chilled or at the canyon end so toss one into your drybag. Quicksand is occasionally encountered in the canyon, which can be a little surprising the first time you experience it. Streamflow of less then 50 cfs is ideal. Streamflow above 50 cfs could prove difficult. Streamflow above 100 cfs could be very dangerous. Visit USGS Streamflow - East Fork Virgin River for current conditions. Navigation for this adventure is difficult, and requires several miles of travel over open terrain. A GPS is very useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Mount Carmel\", \"Springdale East\" and \"The Barracks\" are essential. There is no real trail and several miles of overland navigation is required to complete this route. You will be walking and wading in a canyon bottom for most of this trip, but at the completion you must exit the river bottom and hike out over a difficult to follow route. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Parunuweap Canyon is rated 2C IV using the Canyon Rating System. No Zion backcountry permit is required since the overnight portion of this route is located outside the National Park Boundary. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/parunuweap.htm 1/25/2018 Parunuweap Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 5 Checkerboard Mesa Trailhead: You must leave a shuttle vehicle at the Checkerboard Mesa Trailhead. From the East Entrance to Zion National Park, take Highway 9 into the park for 0.7 miles. Just past the parking area for Checkerboard Mesa there are several small turn-outs that you can park at. You will finish the hike by exiting down the obvious canyon west of Checkerboard Mesa. Mount Carmel Junction Trailhead: After leaving a shuttle vehicle at the Checkerboard Mesa trailhead drive east on Highway 9 to the East Entrance of Zion National Park. From the East Entrance follow Highway 9 east for 13 1/2 miles to Mount Carmel Junction (junction of Highway 9 and Highway 89). Take Highway 89 south for 0.5 miles to a well maintained gravel road on the west side of the highway. Follow this gravel road west for 0.9 miles until you reach a gate across the road. This is the trailhead, find a convenient place off the road to park. Caution: Sections of this route pass near gardens of poison ivy. The poison ivy is easy to avoid if you know what it looks like. Poison ivy has three leaves and is frequently found near water. Poison ivy leaves are green in the summer and red in the fall. Educate yourself before attempting this route. Parunuweap Canyon: From the Mount Carmel Junction Trailhead (N37° 12' 17\", W112° 41' 21\") cross through the gate and begin hiking west on the gravel road. The property inside the gate and for the first couple of miles of this hike are lands leased by the BLM to the Barracks Ranch with a patch of private property sprinkled in. Please respect the property as you cross it and leave all gates open or closed, depending upon how you found them. The BLM lists this road as open to ATV's so my guess is that it is protected as a historic right of way. I am really not sure of the status of this road but I have never heard of anyone having any problems hiking down it. Anyhow, it is very simple and fast to just hike down the road, this causes little if any impact to anyone and you really gain nothing by attempting to drive much further. After leaving the trailhead you will almost immediately cross the river. Just keep walking down the road passing through several gates. One mile from the trailhead you will reach a gate signed \"Private Property\" (N37° 11' 48\", W112° 42' 06\"). At this point follow the 4x4 track down to the river and proceed downstream fording the river as required. 1 3/4 miles from the trailhead you will notice the deep canyon of Monument Hollow to the north joining with Parunuweap (N37° 11' 42\", W112° 42' 52\"). 1/2 mile below this junction and Yellowjacket Canyon (N37° 11' 29\", W112° 43' 16\") joins from the south. 1 1/2 miles below Yellowjacket Canyon, Bay Bill Canyon (N37° 10' 51\", W112° 44' 35\") enters from the south in an area of round sandstone knolls. Just beyond Bay Bill Canyon the 4x4 track leaves the river and climbs to the south toward Elephant Cove. Do not follow the 4x4 track but stay in the river bottom and \"go with the flow\". After leaving Bay Bill Canyon the route winds for 3 3/4 miles through three distinct sections of narrows, past several excellent campsite, next to several springs with clear flowing water until it reaches Mineral Gulch (N37° 10' 31\", W112° 47' 38\"), which enters from the north. Mineral Gulch is easily recognized by the vertical walls surrounding its mouth. Mineral Gulch is worthy of exploring and contains three immaculate sets of narrows. The first set of narrows are short and usually contain deep pools of water. This opens into a shallow section with several caves to explore. The second set of narrows are beyond the cave section and are more inspiring than the first. The most impressive narrows are the third set, which give the http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/parunuweap.htm 1/25/2018 Parunuweap Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 5 impression of entering a deep, dark cave. More narrows exist further up canyon but the bottom three sections are the best. After leaving Mineral Gulch the canyon opens up and provides historic cattle access to the lush river bottom. The cattle route known as the Poverty Trail cross Parunuweap in this section. 2 miles below Mineral Gulch the canyon begins to constrict again and Rock Canyon (N37° 10' 14\", W112° 49' 07\") joins from the south. Rock Canyon normally provides a reliable flow of water. From the junction with Rock Canyon you can reverse your route and hike back up canyon 100-yards, around the bend, to a really nice petroglyph panel (N37° 10' 16\", W112° 49' 03\"). The panel is on the north side of the river on an eastward facing wall. It is 2 3/4 miles from Rock Canyon to Poverty Wash (N37° 10' 37\", W112° 50' 45\"), which enters from the north. Through this section of canyon the walls grow deep and narrow. Several interesting side canyons beg to be explored. Poverty Wash usually has a trickle of water flowing from its mouth. From Poverty Wash it is 1 3/4 miles to where Misery Canyon (N37° 10' 59\", W112° 51' 38\") joins from the north. This section of canyon is the trickiest with several deep pools of water and the biggest obstacle in the route. The obstacle consists of several large boulders in a constricted section of river. The simplest passage is to just climb down through the falls and swim the short pools of water. To avoid the swim it's possible to climb up on a ledge on the south side of the river and follow it downstream for about 50-feet, than drop through a narrow tunnel behind a huge boulder. Misery Canyon is an important landmark for a couple of reasons. The first reason being that it is the beginning of the exit route out of Parunuweap. The second reason is that the bottom section of Misery Canyon is one of the most incredible places on the face of the planet. To explore Misery Canyon you will be required to scramble up a water filled chute into the bowels of the earth. Two people should have no problem climbing up into this canyon by supplying each other a little help. You will encounter a couple of short swims and than find yourself in a magnificent chamber with natural bridges, flowing water, deep pools and a warm sulfur spring. Parunuweap is closed at the Zion Park Boundary, which is approximately 1/2 mile downstream from the mouth of Misery Canyon. Many canyoneers slink downstream past this invisible barrier and visit Labyrinth Falls, which are approximately 3/4 miles below the mouth of Misery Canyon. The section of canyon between Misery Canyon and Labyrinth Falls is some of the deepest and most spectacular narrows in Parunuweap and easily rival those found in it's big brother the Zion Narrows. The Exit: From the mouth of Misery Canyon follow Parunuweap downstream for 1/4 mile to a large horseshoe bend. The exit (N37° 10' 52\", W112° 51' 46\") is out the inside of the horseshoe bend heading north. Look for one of several trails that lead through the bushy area. There is a plaque commemorating the 1872 Powell Expedition where the bushy area meets the rock cliff on the downstream side of the horseshoe bend. The plaque is hidden behind some thick bushes on the north wall. You will discover that the hike from Parunuweap back to the trailhead is 4 1/4 miles and will require about 3 hours. The route is long, hot, sandy, in the sun and uphill. You will require a minimum of 3 liters of water, per person for the hike out on a hot day. It is popular to wait for the cool evening hours to attempt this exit. The exit gully from Parunuweap is 3rd class scrambling for the first 1/4 mile. This exit gully will be laborious for those carrying large packs. Climb to the top of the steep gully and follow the ridge on your west (left) side. You will probably discover cairns and hiker made trails that appear and disappear that will help you stay on route. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/parunuweap.htm 1/25/2018 Parunuweap Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 4 of 5 You will eventually intersect the hiker made trail (N37° 12' 15\", W112° 52' 07\") that is used by technical canyoneers to access the West Fork of Misery Canyon. Turn west on the hiker made trail and follow it to a large sandstone buttress (N37° 12' 31\", W112° 52' 56\"), which marks the east side of Checkerboard Canyon, turn right and head up to the Checkerboard Canyon Saddle (N37° 12' 42\", W112° 53' 00\"). As you climb to Checkerboard Saddle it helps to know that there is a trail on the west side of the gully approximately 100-feet above the canyon bottom that is much easier than bushwhacking and scrambling up the bottom of the gully. From the saddle in Checkerboard Canyon it is all downhill to Highway 9 and the Checkerboard Mesa Trailhead (N37° 13' 35\", W112° 53' 04\"). Obstacles encountered in this last section of canyon are passed on the east side. Sneak-N-Peek Route: A popular 7 to 8 hour Sneak-N-Peek route also exists into Parunuweap Canyon. The Sneak-N-Peek will give you an enjoyable sojourn to a unique and seldom explored canyon. This route will allow you to visit the Powell Plaque, Labyrinth Falls, Misery Canyon and the deepest section of Parunuweap Canyon. The Sneak-N-Peek route involves parking at the Checkerboard Mesa Trailhead and using the exit route described for Misery Canyon to both enter and exit Parunuweap Canyon. A shuttle vehicle is not required when using this option. This is more of an adventure than the normal Zion tourist hike and will require a full day for fit and experienced hikers. Powell Plaque Inscription Reads: \"Major John Wesley Powell 1834-1902 explorer, scientist, Steven V. Jones 1840-1920 teacher, topographer, Joseph W. Young 1829-1873 Mormon pioneer leader, Descended Labyrinth Falls 1/2 mile below Monday, September 30, 1872 during first Parunuweap Canyon traverse. Powell named this canyon from the Paiute Indian word 'Parunuweap' which means roaring water canyon. Dedicated September 30, 1972.\" History: John Wesley Powell first visited and documented Parunuweap in September 1870 during early exploration. Powell named the canyon \"Parunuweap\", a Paiute term that translates as \"Roaring Water Canyon\". The following excerpts are from Powell's journal. September 10 -- The Indian name of the canyon is Paru'nuweap, or Roaring Water Canyon. Between the little river and the foot of the walls is a dense growth of willows, vines, and wild rosebushes, and with great difficulty we make our way through this tangled mass. It is not a wide stream-- only 20 or 30 feet across in most places; shallow, but very swift. After spending some hours in breaking our way through the mass of vegetation and climbing rocks here and there, it is determined to wade along the stream. In some places this is an easy task, but here and there we come to deep holes where we have to wade to our armpits. Soon we come to places so narrow that the river fills the channel and we wade perforce. In many places the bottom is a quicksand, into which we sink, and it is with great difficulty that we make progress. In some places the holes are so deep that we have to swim, and our little bundles of blankets and rations are fixed to a raft made of driftwood and pushed before us. Now and then there is a little flood- plain, on which we can walk, and we cross and recross the stream and wade along the channel where the water is so swift as almost to carry us off our feet and were are in danger every moment of being swept down, until night comes on. Finding a little patch of flood-plain, on which there is a huge pile of driftwood and a clump of box-elders, and near by a mammoth stream bursting from the rocks, we soon have a huge fire. Our clothes are spread to dry; we make a cup of coffee, take out our bread and cheese and dried beef, and enjoy a hearty supper. We estimate that we have traveled eight miles to-day. The canyon here is about 1,200 feet deep. It has been very narrow and winding all the way down to this point. September 11 -- Wading again this morning; sinking in the quicksand, swimming the deep waters, and making slow and painful progress where the waters are swift and the bed of the stream rocky. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/parunuweap.htm 1/25/2018 Parunuweap Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 5 of 5 The canyon is steadily becoming deeper and in many places very narrow-- only 20 or 30 feet wide below, and in some places no wider, and even narrower, for hundreds of feet overhead. There are places where the river in sweeping by curves has cut far under the rocks, but still preserves its narrow channel, so that there is an overhanging wall on one side and an inclined wall on the other. In places a few hundred feet above, it becomes vertical again, and thus the view to the sky is entirely closed. Everywhere this deep passage is dark and gloomy and resounds with the noise of rapid waters. At noon we are in a canyon 2,500 feet deep, and we come to a fall where the walls are broken down and huge rocks beset the channel, on which we obtain a foothold to reach a level 200 feet below. Here the canyon is again wider, and we find a flood-plain along which we can walk, now on this, now on that side of the stream. Gradually the canyon widens; steep rapids, cascades, and cataracts are found along the river, but we wade only where it is necessary to cross. We make progress with very great labor, having to climb over piles of broken rocks.

National Park - Canyoneering Page 1 of 3 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Red Cave Zion National Park Canyoneering An interesting thing happened when I began to ask local residence about the existence of the mysterious slot canyon known as Red Cave. Many had heard about the canyon, some had visited the slot, and no one agreed on its location. So what is the deal? Red Cave is actually two different slot canyons that can be combined into an exciting loop route by the experienced hiker. Novice and shutterbugs can easily visit portions of the two slots separately. The canyons contain outstanding scenery and photographic opportunities. Your camera will love this slot canyon located just outside of Zion National Park. General Information: Red Cave is actually two separate slot canyons known locally as Lower Red Cave and Upper Red Cave. Lower Red Cave is located in Lower Sand Wash and Upper Red Cave is located in Upper Sand Wash. It is possible for novice hikers and families to visit the lower section of both slot canyons. The route required to visit the complete slots and combine the canyons into a loop route is a semi-technical canyoneering adventure. These canyons are distinctively photogenic. Those who want to visit the entire canyon system will need at least one experienced canyoneer, hiker or rock climber along to help defeat a few obstacles. If you can only visit one of the slots than I suggest Upper Red Cave because hikers and photographers will get a bigger bang for their buck. The route presented below will be in a counterclockwise direction since I think it makes navigation slightly easier. Also if you can get up lower Red Cave you should have no problems getting down Upper Red Cave. The route can be done in either direction or you can make up your own. The complete loop route will require 4 to 5 hours to complete. A car shuttle is not required for this adventure. You will need a 60-foot rope for hand lines, belays, lowering packs and possible emergency use. Red Cave usually contains some water ranging in depth from knee to chest deep. The water is always cold and murky. You will often be walking and wading in a canyon bottom. If it has rained recently the canyon floor will be covered with slippery mud. Wetsuits are recommended if the temperature is cool. \"Mount Carmel\" is the USGS 7.5 minute topographical map that shows Red Cave. Navigation for this adventure is moderate, there is no established trail. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Red Cave is rated 2B II using the Canyon Rating System. You do not need a Zion backcountry permit for this canyon because it is located outside the National Park. Red Cave has a moderate flashflood danger. Check the weather report before entering the canyon. Written Permission Required: Written permission is required to access Red Cave as you will be crossing private property. Permission can be obtained from the Del Tait family located at 2410 South State in Mount Carmel (at the head of Tait Lane, which is on your way). It's wise to call ahead to make certain someone will be home, Del Tait: 1-435-648-2522. Please be on your best behavior and make http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/redcave.htm 1/25/2018 Red Cave - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 certain you call or visit during reasonable hours. Currently this is the only access to Red Cave and it would be a shame if it was lost through the poor behavior of a few. Trailhead Information: To drive to the trailhead mentioned a 4x4 vehicle is required. It is possible for those without four wheel drive to hike to the trailhead of this slot canyon. it's not that hard of a hike. If hiking in please park at the Old Rock Church on Highway 89, in Mount Carmel. Do not park on Tait Lane or at the gate. From Mount Carmel Junction (Junction of Highway 89 and Highway 6), drive north on Highway 89 for 2.0 miles to Tait Lane (N37° 14' 56\", W112° 39' 46\"). Stop and pick up your written permission. Turn east on Tait Lane and drive for 0.1 miles and cross the East Fork of the Virgin River, continue following Tait Lane for an additional 0.1 miles to a Gate (N37° 14' 52\", W112° 39' 32\"). Pass through the gate and shut it behind you so Tait's animals do not escape. After passing through the gate immediately turn left and pass to the west side of the barn and corral. Soon the road will fork, stay to the right. 20-yards further the road forks again, stay to the right. Follow the road as it climbs to the top of the hill. 1.0 miles after passing through the gate you will arrive at a fork in the road (N37° 14' 30\", W112° 38' 54\"), with a nice view of the wash below. Take the right (south) fork that descends steeply to the bottom of Upper Sand Wash. The bottom of the wash is the Red Cave Trailhead (N37° 14' 21\", W112° 38' 56\"), it is possible to drive to the actual bottom of both Upper and Lower Read Cave slots, but if doing the complete loop this is as good of spot as any to start from. Route Information: From the Red Cave Trailhead (N37° 14' 21\", W112° 38' 56\"), hike west (downstream) for 1/2 mile and you will note a junction with an ATV track departing to the east (N37° 14' 18\", W112° 39' 26\"). This is the same ATV track you will crossed later in the day on the ridge between Lower and Upper Red Cave. It is possible to use this ATV track to reach the top of both Upper and Lower Red Cave. From the junction with the ATV track continue hiking downstream for an additional 1/2 mile until a large wash enters from the south (left), this is Lower Sand Wash (N37° 14' 05\", W112° 39' 51\"). Hike up Lower Sand Wash for 1 1/4 miles to the entrance of Lower Red Cave (N37° 13' 32\", W112° 38' 54\"). Enter the slot canyon and hike inside a couple hundred yards until stopped by a 20-foot dryfall. The dryfall is the biggest obstacle in the route. 25-feet beyond the first dryfall is a second 20-foot dryfall. This two tiered obstacle is the biggest problem you will encounter on the route. This obstacle is easiest to defeat by exiting the slot and climbing the sandy hill to the south. Follow the edge of the slot from above until you find an easy place to climb back down to the canyon bottom. There are several easy places to climb down so if something does not look safe move along to an easier spot. You can easily backtrack in the canyon from above to the top of the two tiered dryfall so don't worry about missing any of the good stuff. Above the two tiered dryfall just keep hiking up canyon for 1 mile overcoming minor obstacles as they present themselves. Lower Red Cave is divided into several sections of narrows. Just when you think there is no more slot it narrows up again. Eventually the canyon opens up at the top of the slot section (N37° 13' 12\", W112° 38' 19\"). From the top of Lower Red Cave you can hike cross-country to Upper Red Cave. From the top of Lower Red Cave hike north and after crossing several minor drainage's you will intersect a ATV track (N37° 13' 40\", W112° 38' 21\"), this is the same ATV track mentioned earlier. After crossing the ATV track work your way 1/4 mile north and down to the bottom of a major drainage (N37° 13' 47\", W112° 38' 10\"). This drainage is a fork of Upper Red Cave. Begin hiking west down the drainage and enjoy the fun. After 1/2 mile of hiking down canyon the bottom drops out of the drainage you have been following in a two-step tier of 8-foot and 10-foot drops and forms a tee junction into a second slot. This is the top of Upper Red Cave (N37° 14' 09\", W112° 38' 22\"). It's possible to http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/redcave.htm 1/25/2018 Red Cave - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 downclimb into the slot at this point, but it is much easier to just hike 150 yards north, over a small knoll, to where you can just walk into the slot with no risk. Look for the large Ponderosa pine and hike to its base for an easy walk in entrance. Once you have entered the top of Upper Red Cave just scramble, wade and downclimb through the slot. This section of slot is 1/4 mile long but feels much longer because the minor obstacles cascade into each other with little rest in between. This section of canyon is always filled with water of varying depths. Upon reaching the bottom of Upper Red Cave (N37° 14' 13\", W112° 38' 32\") the slot breaks out into the open in dramatic fashion. From this point just begin following Sand Wash downstream. After 1/2 mile downstream you will be back that the Red Cave Trailhead.

Past inhabitants include Archaic, Anasazi, Fremont and Southern Paiute. Any or all of these groups may have contributed Rock Art to the Zion area. Please help protect this legacy; look, but don't touch. As you enjoy these images please remember to take only pictures and leave only footprints. Most of the figures in the Zion area are petroglyphs, which means they were pecked or scratched into the rock. There are some pictographs, which means the image was painted. You will find an abundance of figures including anthropomorphs (human like figures), concentric circles, spirals, snakes and Zoomorphs (animal like figures). South Gate Petroglyphs: The South Gate panel is extremely easy to access which has resulted in vandalism over the years. The panel contains about a dozen images with a spiral and a Zoomorph being most prominent. Among the jumble of contemporary etchings is what some speculate is an ancient summer solstice marker. Once a year, on June 21, a jagged rock casts a shadow resembling the open jaw of a coyote onto the face of Sacrifice Rock. As the sun rises higher, the shadow \"swallows\" a petroglyph in the shape of a spiral. Directions: From the South Gate Entrance Station drive east on Highway 9 for 250-yards. The rock art panel (N37° 12' 15\", W112° 59' 12\") is located 50-yards north of Highway 9 on the south face of a large rock that resembles an arrowhead stuck point first into the ground. This Large rock is known as \"Sacrifice Rock\". There is a small National Park Service sign next to the panel reminding you to behave yourself. Deertrap Petroglyphs: To view the Deertrap panel you must be willing to hike one mile over unmarked slickrock. The panel contains many faded petroglyphs. Most of the images are anthropomorphs and Zoomorphs. The hike to the panel will require about one hour each way and is best done in the cool morning or evening hours. This is a gratifying hike in an uncrowded setting. Directions: From the South Gate Entrance Station take Highway 9 west through the park towards the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel. The Trailhead is located 0.4 miles after you the exit of the tunnel. The moment you exit the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel check your mileage. There are several large pull- outs just below the actual Trailhead. There is no safe parking at the trailhead, please find a safe place to park where your vehicle will not be a nuisance. From the trailhead (N37° 12' 56\", W112° 56' 08\") begin hiking north up the bottom of Pine Creek Canyon. Hike up canyon for 1/2 mile (15 minutes) to where the canyon begins to narrow (N37° 13' 25\", W112° 56' 18\"). Exit the canyon to the west and begin climbing up the slickrock taking the path of least resistance. The slickrock is steep in places but should be no problem if you carefully route find. If the going gets difficult look around because there is an easier way. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/zionrockart.htm 1/25/2018 Rockart - Zion National Park Page 2 of 2 Your target is just below the obvious pass between East Temple and Deertrap Mountain. As you near the pass there is a faded panel of petroglyphs (N37° 13' 35\", W112° 56' 34\") that contains a large number of figures. The petroglyphs are located on a 30-foot tall cliff that intersects your route to the pass. This is also the beginning of the popular Spry Canyon technical canyoneering route. Petroglyph Canyon: The Petroglyph Canyon archeological site contains two panels of rock art totaling over 150 figures. Almost all of the figures are petroglyphs with one lone pictograph. This is the best rock art site in Zion National Park. The North Panel contains at least 76 figures, including the site's only pictograph - a small red triangle. The site contains numerous images of the ever popular Kokopelli. There is something appealing about Kokopelli. which fascinates all kinds of people, even in our modern technological age. Between the two panels, is a series of wide grooves along a rock shelf about knee height. These grooves are the result of tool sharpening. The South Panel is 200 feet from the North Panel on the same cliff face. It contains at least 77 figures. Most are animals with an abundance of bighorn sheep. Directions: From the South Gate Entrance Station take Highway 9 west into the park and through the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel. After you exit the tunnel continue east on Highway 9 until you encounter a second, much shorter tunnel. The moment you exit the second tunnel check your mileage. From the second tunnel exit it is 1.3 miles to the trailhead which is easily identified by a pull-out on the south side of the road and a wooden fence. There is also a sign, which states \"No Bus Parking\". From the trailhead the rock art panels are locate up the obvious canyon to the north. the easiest and safest way to reach the panels is to hike down into the immediate streambed and follow it into the canyon. There is a large and interesting masonry structure which allows access under Highway 9. This keeps you off the highway and is something else to admire on your short stroll. After exiting the tunnel under Highway 9 hike up canyon 100-yards and the rock art is located on two panels on the cliff to the west (N37° 13' 35\", W112° 54' 38\"). There is a register with some information located midway between the two panels. Video: Enjoy a short entertaining video of a trip to Petroglyph Canyon. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.

The canyon is seldom visited and removed from the crowds of Zion National Park. This route provides an entertaining half-day escapade and dinner at one of the finest eating establishment in Southern Utah. General Information: Red Hollow is a fun canyon that is off the beaten path. The canyon requires complete technical gear to descend. In normal conditions this canyon is dry with possible knee deep wading. The canyon is accessible year round unless there is snow on the ground. A vehicle shuttle is required to complete this route. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is 3 to 4 hours. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Glendale\" are essential. Navigation for this route is easy. All waypoints and maps for Red Hollow use the WGS84 datum. Red Hollow is rated 3A II using the Canyon Rating System. You do not need a Zion backcountry permit for this canyon because it is located outside the National Park. Red Hollow has a moderate flash flood danger. Two 60 meter ropes are required. Two 300 foot ropes are optional. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 100 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. The canyon currently contains no bolted anchors. Please do your best to preserve this feature. Many canyoneers before you have descended this canyon without placing bolts, so please play fair. You might need to locate and construct natural anchors, which should be considered part of the game. The problem solving involved with using natural anchors and teamwork is considered to be a major part of the adventure with this route. Part of the appeal of this canyon is that many of the obstacles can be downclimb instead of rappelled. Lower Red Hollow Trailhead: Follow Highway 89 to Orderville. Turn south on 100 East at the the Centennial School. Follow the road until it tee's with Red Hollow Drive. Turn east (left) on Red Hollow Drive and follow the road a short distance to the end of the pavement. This is the Lower Red Hollow Trailhead. It is identified by a large area to turn around and park out of the way. This is where you must leave your shuttle vehicle. Upper Red Hollow Trailhead: From the Lower Red Hollow Trailhead return to Highway 89 and drive 4 1/2 miles north to the town of Glendale. At the north end of town you will notice the Buffalo Bistro on the west side of the highway. This establishment has some of the best food in all of Southern Utah, don't say I didn't tell you! Directly across Highway 89 from the Buffalo Bistro you will note a paved road heading east that is signed \"Glendale Bench\". Follow the paved Glendale Bench Road east for 1.5 miles to where it crests the top of the cliffs and meets a dirt road connecting from the south (right). Turn south on the dirt road and follow the main dirt road for 4.2 miles to the Upper Red Hollow Trailhead. There is no major landmark to identify the trailhead. You should be sitting in a http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/redhollow.htm 1/25/2018 Red Hollow - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 obvious large drainage that flows west toward Red Hollow. Find a safe place to park off the main road. Recently I have received reports that the dirt road to the upper trailhead has a gate and is signed \"No Trespassing\". To date the property owner has been good about allowing access to those who seek permission, use good manners and promise to close the gate. Sorry, but I do not have contact information for the property owner. In normal conditions the main dirt road is suitable for passenger cars. I have seen the road become deeply rutted in early spring or after an extended period of poor weather. In less then ideal conditions the road did not require 4x4 but did have some deep ruts that required a high clearance vehicle to straddle. Route Information: From the Upper Red Hollow Trailhead (N37° 16' 05\", W112° 35' 59\") hike down the drainage in a westerly direction. Not long after leaving the trailhead you should encounter a spring and cross a fence. Keep hiking down stream and enjoy the enchanting stroll. One mile after leaving the trailhead you will encounter the massive canyon headwall (N37° 16' 00\", W112° 36' 53\"). The canyon headwall is where things get interesting. If you brought along your 300-foot ropes you can rappel directly down the gut of the canyon. The rappel has been measured at 295- feet, with approximately 280-feet of free air. For those with standard length ropes you can move north or south and set up a shorter entrance rappel. Moving north provides the shortest rappel down a rocky gully. Moving south it is possible to set up a nice rappel in the 190 to 200 foot range. Pick your poison. From the bottom of the headwall just keep hiking down canyon. You will encounter at least two more short rappels of less then 30-feet and maybe more depending on you downclimbing skills. After the headwall entrance there are no obstacles that I would classify as extremely difficult. Just your typical technical slot canyon type stuff of over, under or around problems to solve. 1 1/2 miles below the headwall you will arrive at the Lower Red Hollow Trailhead (N37° 16' 23\", W112° 38' 02\"). Don't forget to stop for dinner at the Buffalo Bistro to complete this adventure. Hiking Information: It is possible for hikers to visit a large portion of Red Hollow. Park at the Lower Trailhead and hike up the obvious canyon to the east as far as time and skill allow.

Several technical challenges provide the right amount of zest to make this stroll through the wilderness a memorable experience. General Information: Rock Canyon is best described as a spicy promenade through three beautiful canyons. This area known as \"The Barracks\" is remote and seldom visited. Total time required form trailhead to trailhead is 6 to 7 hours. Rock Canyon requires complete technical gear. This route is considered easy by technical standards, but don't let that dissuade you. The scenery is spectacular. This route is located outside of Zion National Park and a backcountry permit is not required. The route includes several miles of hiking down Parunuweap Canyon. In normal conditions this section of the route requires knee to possible waist deep wading. Normal conditions are less then 50 cfs of streamflow. Visit USGS Streamflow - East Fork Virgin River for current conditions. Quicksand is occasionally encountered in the canyon, which can be a little surprising the first time you experience it. The longest rappel in the canyon is 110-feet. Two 120-foot ropes or a reasonable method of rigging a 110-foot rappel are required. We used a 60-meter rope, a biner block, and 20-feet of webbing as a pull chord. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is extremely useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"The Barracks\" are essential. Navigation for this route is moderate, but mistakes in navigation could be brutal. All waypoints and maps for Rock Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Rock Canyon is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. This route has a moderate flashflood danger and includes a massive drainage area. Check the local weather report before entering this canyon. Trailhead Information: A true 4-wheel drive vehicle is required to access the trailhead. The road to the trailhead is sandy, in late summer the road often becomes extremely sandy. ATV's would provide a good alternative method of accessing the trailhead. A vehicle shuttle is not required to complete this route. The area is criss-crossed with roads. Stay on the road described until told to turn off of it. From the Utah town of Mount Carmel Junction drive south on Highway 89 for 3.4 miles to the signed Corral Pink Sand Dunes turn-off. Follow the access road southeast for 0.3 miles to a junction with a sign pointing the way to the Pink Corral Sand Dunes and reading Elephant Cove 16 miles. This paved road is known as \"Yellowjacket Road\". From the junction follow Yellowjacket Road southwest for 16.0 miles to the Elephant Cove Jeep Trail (N37° 01' 28\", W112° 48' 09\"). Turn north (right) and follow the dirt road north for 3.4 miles to a fork (N37° 04' 16\", W112° 48' 10\"). Take the west (left) fork signed K1265. Follow K1265 northwest for 0.9 miles to a fork (N37° 04' 49\", W112° 48' 48\"). Take the north (right) fork signed K1280. Follow K1280 northwest for 4.4 miles to a junction (N37° 07' 26\", W112° 51' 22\"). Take the north (right) fork signed K1290. Follow K1290 north for 0.9 miles to a fork (N37° http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/rock.htm 1/25/2018 Rock Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 08' 11\", W112° 51' 14\"). Take the west (left) fork signed K1290. Follow K1290 north for 2.3 miles to the Rock Canyon Trailhead (N37° 09' 52\", W112° 50' 28\"). The Rock Canyon Trailhead consists of a wide place to turn around, plenty of parking, and several nice primitive campsites. This is an outstanding place to camp. Caution: Sections of this route pass near large gardens of poison ivy. The poison ivy is easy to avoid if you know what it looks like. Poison ivy has three leaves and is frequently found near water. Poison ivy leaves are green in the summer and red in the fall. Educate yourself before attempting this route. Route Information: From the Rock Canyon Trailhead (N37° 09' 52\", W112° 50' 28\") continue hiking the 4x4 road eastward for 3/4 miles to where the 4x4 road loops back north (N37° 09' 43\", W112° 49' 58\"). After leaving the 4x4 road you must head southeast, cross- country, for 3/4 miles to the start of the technical section of Rock Canyon (N37° 09' 23\", W112° 49' 36\"). The approach to Rock Canyon requires approximately one hour. The first obstacle consists of two potholes followed by a 40-foot drop. You can chimney the potholes to stay dry. The rappel is anchored from a huge log wedged in the canyon above the potholes. It is also possible to by-pass this obstacle around either side with a little route finding. But because you are a canyoneer its down the gut you go. The second obstacle is immediately down canyon and consists of a 100-foot curling sandstone V-slot. This section is super simple to downclimb. There is a bolt at the top of this section that is completely unnecessary. Next is anther easy 10-foot downclimb, which is a little bit harder then the first. This small drop is again guarded by a bolt at the top. It appears as if someone has bought stock in Hilti. If you are unsure of your downclimbing skills this is a good place to practice a partner assist. A short stroll brings you to the Big Rappel and one of the most beautiful features in Rock Canyon. The Big Rappel is 110-feet and is anchored by two bolts at the top. This rappel deposits you in a extraordinary alcove. The route continues down canyon as a hike for sometime before you encounter the final technical obstacle. This obstacle consists of a 20-foot high cliff band blocking the canyon. The cliff band can be downclimbed but the penalty points are high if you screw up. The rappel is 20- feet and anchored by two bolts. Pack away the technical gear and continue down canyon. You will soon encounter a beautiful spring fed grotto cover in lush vegetation. Not too far below the grotto you will encounter Parunuweap (N37° 10' 14\", W112° 49' 07\"). The route from the top of Rock Canyon to Parunuweap is approximately 1 1/4 miles and should required about 2 hours. From the junction with Parunuweap you can hike up canyon 100-yards, around the bend, to a really nice petroglyph panel (N37° 10' 16\", W112° 49' 03\"). The panel is on the north side of the river on an eastward facing wall. After admiring the rock art begin hiking down Parunuweap. The next 2 3/4 miles should be an enjoyable hike down the East Fork of the Virgin River. The route passes through some remote and seldom visited country. The Parunuweap section of the canyon requires about 2 hours of river hiking. Keep track of your travels down Parunuweap using a good map and/or a GPS. As you near your exit point Parunuweap makes a tight horseshoe bend and you will see a large canyon exiting south out of the top of the horseshoe. This is NOT the exit canyon. You must continue hiking downstream and additional 100-yards to where a slot canyon joins Parunuweap http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/rock.htm 1/25/2018 Rock Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 from the south. This slot canyon is often referred to as French Canyon (N37° 10' 31\", W112° 50' 40\") and is the canyon you exit up. Do not miss this exit or you might have a long day. Your GPS should work in this section of Parunuweap. Hike up the enchanting French Canyon, with its small stream, using caution to stay out of the poison ivy. The poison ivy is easy to avoid if you know what it looks like (poison ivy has three leaves). Just above the spring feeding French Canyon you will be presented with a dryfall followed by a massive headwall. At first it looks like there is no escape. Close inspection reveals a hiker trail around the dryfall on the west (right) side. Climb up this hiker made trail, cross the canyon to the east at the top of the dryfall, and follow a hiker made trail that exploits a ledge to exit the canyon to the rim. Once on the canyon rim hike south up the ridge. At the top of the ridge you should discover and abandoned 4x4 road that leads directly back to the trailhead. The hike from Parunuweap back to the trailhead is 1 mile long and requires about one hour. Emergency Escape Information: If after descending Rock Canyon you discover the East Fork of the Virgin River is flowing at a dangerous level, it is possible to escape Parunuweap by working your way up the ledges on the west side of the canyon where Parunuweap meets Rock Canyon. After climbing out the ledges just walk the 4x4 road back to the trailhead.

Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Telephone Canyon Zion National Park Technical Canyoneering Telephone Canyon involves a long hike, a high number of rappels, and descends through a beautiful and seldom visited slot canyon. This canyon does not receive near the traffic of many other Zion canyoneering routes, but the approach route is heavily traveled as it visits the popular Angels Landing and West Rim. General Information: Telephone Canyon is a nice route for those seeking something a little different then the standard trade routes. Total time required from trailhead to trailhead is approximately 7 to 8 hours. Telephone Canyon requires complete technical gear. Telephone Canyon is rated 3A III using the Canyon Rating System. This canyon requires moderate anchor building skills and is not a good route for beginners or youth groups. The canyon is normally dry, but during wet periods and early spring it is not unusual to encounter several pools that require wading. The route contains somewhere between 9 to 14 rappels depending on how you rig your rappels, what rappels you decide to chain together and what you decide to downclimb. Plan on rappel lengths up to 200-feet requiring two 60-meter ropes. Additional gear should consist of several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, 50 feet of webbing, several rapid links, and a prusik system. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' Map titled \"Temple of Sinawava\" are essential. Navigation for this adventure is moderate. Telephone Canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the weather report at the Visitor Center when you pick up your permit. All waypoints and maps for Telephone Canyon use the WGS84 datum. Always check your GPS to ensure that WGS84 is the datum before entering a waypoint into your unit. A Zion backcountry permit is required to descend this canyon. Trailhead Information: From the main Zion Canyon Visitor's Center take the Zion Canyon Shuttle to the Grotto Picnic Area located in Zion Canyon. Since this adventure is a popular early and late season trip the shuttle might not be operating and you may need to drive to the Grotto Picnic Area. This trailhead is also the start of the very popular Angel's Landing Trail. Route Information: From the Grotto Picnic Area (N37° 15' 33\", W112° 57' 02\"), take the paved West Rim Trail towards Angels Landing. The route snakes up Refrigerator Canyon and climbs the famous Walter's Wiggles to Scout Lookout (N37° 16' 30\", W112° 57' 01\"). The trail divides here with the Right Fork leading to Angel's Landing and the Left Fork leading to the West Rim. Visiting Angel's Landing will add 1 hour to your adventure. From Scout Lookout, continue climbing the West Rim Trail. Go past the start of the popular Behunin Canyon (N37° 16' 57\", W112° 58' 11\") and continue hiking up the switchbacks to the West Rim Trail Junction (N37° 17' 12\", W112° 58' 07\") signed \"West Rim Trail\", \"Telephone Canyon\" and \"Cabin Spring\". It will require approximately 2 hours to reach the West Rim Trail Junctionfrom the trailhead. Note: Due to a 2007 wildfire the Telephone Canyon trail is currently closed, but Zion Park permits canyoneers to go as far as the start of Telephone canyon and the canyon is open. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/telephone.htm 1/25/2018 Telephone Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 2 From the West Rim Trail junction, hike north on the trail signed Telephone Canyon for 1/3 mile (N37° 17' 31\", W112° 58' 08\"). At this point you need to hike east approximately 150- yards to the head of Telephone Canyon (N37° 17' 34\", W112° 58' 04\"). This area was burned in a 2007 wild fire. The first rappel is 30-feet to a shelf with several trees, the anchor for the first rappel is currently a burned stump but for safety should probably be relocated to a tree that avoided the fire. The second rappel is where things get interesting. The rappel anchor is a large tree. This rappel can be rigged as one long 200-foot rappel or broken into several stages where bolted anchors are located, you make the call. This is usually the longest rappel in the canyon depending on how you rig future rappels. The first 100-feet of this rappel are free hanging. After the second rappel the canyon contains approximately 10 more rappels depending on what rappels you string together and what you decide to downclimb. The remaining rappel anchors are a mix of logs, trees, chokestones and bolts. The final rappel is 70-feet and made in an area of recent rock fall. After the final rappel hike downstream to where the slot becomes shallower and begins to open up, at this point you should be able to easily make your way south and intersect the West Rim Trail (N37° 17' 13\", W112° 57' 39\"). Once you have regained the West Rim Trail hike back to the Grotto Trailhead. Optional Tele-hunin Route: For strong and fast canyoneers it has become popular to combine Telephone Canyon with Behunin Canyon. The idea is you only have to hike a little extra to get two canyons for the price of one. Get an early start, descend Telephone, check your time, hike back up to the start of Behunin and descend Behunin Canyon. This option is only recommended for small groups of experienced canyoneers.

Park Page 1 of 1 [ Homepage ] [ Introduction ] [ Warning ] [ Ratings ] [ Ethics ] [ Feedback ] [ Updates ] Zion Swimming Hole Zion National Park Family Fun One of the best places to hang out on a hot summer afternoon is the Zion Swimming Hole. Plenty of fun to be found for all ages. General Information: The Zion Swimming Hole is fun for the entire family and involves a very short walk to access. On a hot summer afternoon plan to spend a couple of hours enjoying the cool, clear waters. This is a special place, please do your part to keep it that way. Pack out all trash when you leave. Jumping form the high rocks surrounding the swimming hole is very popular. Please be sure and check the water depth before jumping as the swimming hole contains at least two large rocks that have caused injuries in the past. Please use commonsense on your visit. A GPS is not required to locate the swimming hole. The USGS 7.5' Maps titled \"Springdale East\" shows the area described. Navigation for this route is extremely easy. All waypoints and maps use the WGS84 datum. The Zion Swimming Hole is rated 1C I using the Canyon Rating System. Trailhead Information: Take Highway 9 west from the visitors center towards the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel. The Zion Swimming Hole Trailhead is located at the 2nd switchback up Highway 9 (second from either direction). There is parking for approximately 10 vehicles on the inside of the switchback. Route Information: From the trailhead walk to the north side of the road, climb over the short retaining wall, locate an easy to identify hiker trail and follow it down for 30-yards to the small stream below. The trail ends at the stream and Zion Swimming Hole (N37° 12' 53\", W112° 57' 27\"). Enjoy the fun. Please pack out all of your trash and a little extra. Video: A fun video of the fun to be found.

The route climbs up the canyon along the side of the narrow technical slot. Canyoneering this technical slot does not require a permit, which makes it the perfect option when the Zion Permit system plays havoc with your plans and schedule. This is a really good canyon and should be on everyone's tick list. General Information: Water Canyon is a technical canyoneering adventure that will require complete technical gear. The full top to bottom route described normally requires 7 to 8 hours to complete. The route can easily be shortened by dropping into the canyon earlier at one of several optional access points. Water Canyon is rated 3B III using the Canyon Rating System. During the hot summer months you will want to get an early start to avoid hiking up in the heat of the day. Water Canyon is outside of Zion National Park and a Zion Backcountry Permit is not required. The canyon is popular with the local guides and hikers so don't expect a quiet and secluded backcountry experience. The complete route contains up to 9 rappels with the highest being 170-feet. Several of the rappels can be circumvented or hiked around if you so desire. The canyon offers many different options depending on your requirements. In addition to two 60-meter ropes you will need, 20-feet of webbing, several shoulder length slings, a couple double length slings, several rapid links, a prusik system and a drybag for your gear. Because the route is popular with the local guides the rappel anchors in this canyon are usually of high quality and well maintained. This canyon requires knee to chest deep wading and usually one short swim of 20-feet. Wetsuits are generally only worn in cold weather or by the cold blooded as the pools are normally short and the canyon receives plenty of sunlight to warm up in. A GPS is useful. Good map reading skills and the USGS 7.5' map titled \"Hildale\" are essential. Navigation for this adventure is moderate. All waypoints and maps for this route use the WGS84 datum. Water Canyon has a moderate flash flood danger, check the local weather report. The entire drainage and a clear view of the western sky are visible before committing to the canyon. Trailhead Information: The Water Canyon Trailhead is normally accessible to all vehicles in good weather conditions, however the last two miles are on a dirt road and I've seen it get a little ugly if it hasn't been graded in a while. High clearance vehicles should never have an issue. From Center Street and Main Street in Hurricane Utah drive one block south on Main Street, turn east (left) on Highway 59 and follow it for 21.8 miles to Utah Avenue in the twin towns of Hildale/Colorado City. The Town is Hildale on the Utah side of the state line and Colorado City on the Arizona side of the border. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/zionwater.htm 1/25/2018 Water Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 2 of 3 Turn east (left) on Utah Avenue and follow it for 2.1 miles to where the street sweeps north (left) and becomes Canyon Street. Continue north on Canyon Street for 0.8 miles to Water Canyon Road, which is dirt. Turn east (right) on Water Canyon Road and follow it for 0.8 miles to a fork. Take the east (right) fork and drive an addition 0.2 miles to a second fork. Take the west (left) fork and drive an additional 0.9 miles to the end of the road and a large dirt parking area. This is the trailhead for Water Canyon, it's easy to identify as the parking area is next to a large pond. Route Information: From the Water Canyon Trailhead (N37° 02' 16\", W112° 57' 19\"), follow the well traveled trail as it heads north into Water Canyon. The trail up the canyon is braided with numerous social trails, usually the trails come back together or descend to the stream. As a general rule follow the most well traveled trail, when in doubt take the west (left) trail and you will usually be on the correct trail. Mistakes in trail selection are not a major issue and easy to overcome, but they can be annoying if your navigation needs improvement. If you find yourself on a seldom traveled trail you are not on course. Approximately 1 mile from the trailhead everything comes together where the canyon squeezes down to about 10-feet wide and a stream cascades down a small waterfall (N37° 02' 56\", W112° 57' 37\"). You must hike up the small waterfall and continue upstream. 150-yards from the base of the small waterfall you will reach a dryfall and a spring, the dryfall is also the bottom of the final rappel on your way down. From the base of the dryfall the trail leaves the canyon bottom and snakes up the west (left) wall. Just keep following the trail up as it climbs the canyon. After 1/3 mile the trail will make a large U-turn (N37° 03' 12\", W112° 57' 53\"). Dropping to the canyon bottom from the U-turn offers an optional entrance to the lower technical section of canyon for those wanting a short day. This entrance drops you into the main canyon just above rappel #5. Everyone else just keep hiking up from the U-turn as the trail climbs steeply and snakes up the canyon wall for 1/3 mile until you top out at a large boulder known as Top Rock (N37° 03' 08\", W112° 57' 54\"). From Top Rock the trail can be confusing and disappear. Just hike in a northeast direction for 250-yards following one of the many small drainages down to the top of a small gully (N37° 03' 13\", W112° 58' 02\"). The small gully allows access to the bottom of Water Canyon, you will know you're in the correct place when you see a large hoodoo (N37° 03' 15\", W112° 58' 02\") that marks the beginning of the technical section of canyon. From this point forward it's nearly impossible to get lost, just follow the watercourse downstream, there are no real obstacles in this canyon except for the rappels. Several of the rappels have optional walk-arounds if you if look for them and want to use them. Rappel #1 is 80-feet and anchored from a tree on the edge of the drop, or more commonly from a large tree 30-feet back of the drop. The rappel might deposit you in a pool that is knee to waist deep. Rappel #2 is immediately downstream and is a two-stage affair. The anchor is a bolt on the east (left) wall. The first stage is 10-feet and deposits you in a small pool that is usually a short swim, the second stage is 15-feet and might deposit you in a knee deep pool. This is probably the most difficult rappel on the route, and only because of rope management. The first person down will need to fish the rope out of the pool and extend it over the second drop. http://www.climb-utah.com/pr/zionwater.htm 1/25/2018 Water Canyon - Zion National Park - Canyoneering Page 3 of 3 Rappel #3 is 30-feet and anchored from a bolt on the west (right) wall. Near the bottom of the rappel is a small but deep pothole which is easy to step across. The pothole is a very interesting feature. This rappel deposits you at the top of the next rappel. Rappel #4 is 170-feet and anchored from bolts on the west (right) wall. The rappel deposits you into a spectacular looking pool that is usually about waist to chest deep. The rappel is followed by a terrific, but short section of slot canyon. The slot deposits you on an open ledge above the next section of canyon. The best way down this ledge is to follow the ledge system north (left) and it will allow access to the canyon bottom. Continue hiking downstream and you will encounter a pool that could be a possible swim depending on shifting sand conditions. Rappel #5 is 25-feet and anchored from a small pine tree. Rappel #6 is 60-feet and anchored from a large ponderosa pine tree. Rappel #7 is 70-feet and anchored from a large ponderosa pine tree. The first 25- feet of the rappel are gently sloping before it drops over the edge for the final 45-feet. Rappel #8 is right next to the trail you hiked up earlier in the day. The rappel is 110-feet and the bolted anchors are located down in the small slot next to the hiking trail. This is a really pretty rappel, but you can easily skip it by just hiking back down the main trail. This rappel might deposit you in a pool that is knee to waist deep. Rappel #9 is 40 feet and anchored by two bolts. This rappel will deposit you near the top of the small waterfall you hiked over earlier in the day. All that's left is the hike back down canyon to the trailhead. Water Canyon Trail History: The trail you hike to access the top of Water Canyon is actually an old stock trail used to move cattle from Hildale to the top of the Mesa. The trail has fallen into disrepair and there is not a chance in hell of cattle using it today. But it's still interesting as you hike to the top of Water Canyon to note many of the cuts and some of the blasting that was done to originally create the stock trail. Video: Enjoy a short entertaining video of a trip through Water Canyon. Hiking Water Canyon: Water Canyon also makes for a nice hike with no technical obstacles. The route is simple, just follow the route description above to Top Rock and return the way you came. The round trip hike to Top Rock and back requires approximately 4 hours.
